In the latest CS61A official website, I seem could not access to the lecture (i literally mean lecture, instead of the video) due to the authentication of CalNet ID. may I know if there's any way I could access them, as well as other course material so that I can try to mimic the UCB student's experience as much as possible.\n2. Else, I know there's a lot versions of past semester course archieve whether in youtube or other website. May I know which version do you guys recommend to take (preferarably the python version than scheme unless you have different suggestion?). Note that I understand that different version may not differ much, but given that there's a choice for me at this point, why not just choose the 'best' one.\n3.

      "title": "my opinion on cs classes",
      "content": "Here is my review of Berkeley EECS classes as a graduating senior from a throwaway account because I can. I will discuss perspectives that have been discussed only behind closed doors among the students.\n\n61A/B/C : practical classes that made you fall in love with CS. Assignments that actually make you feel like you learn and accomplish something.\n\nCheating level in the class: 3/10. I do think that a lot of people cheat in this class, but I also believe that with the 61A/B/C series, most people are trying to \"cheat to learn.\" (That is why my rate is so low)\n\nTA and support review: 8/10 I do not think there is enough support for people who are falling behind, and the support they have right now is useless (if you do not know, there are specific discussions for people who got less than 20% on the exam). My negative review for those classes is because they teach you 1+1 = 2, and the exam level is like giving the differential equations to 5 graders. Exams are not ESL-friendly. I am surprised that no one EVER talks about it. While those classes are very popular among international students who pass English-level requirements, long and confusing 20-line problems should not be allowed. Do not get me wrong, write the most confusing/complicated stuff of your life, but make it in more straightforward language. It's an introduction level class where people should feel comfortable and not stressed out because of the English language.\n\nEECS16A/16B : I am not into the EE part of the major, but the labs made me think about it!\n\nCheating level in the class: 11/10. With a class of 800 people, you could see 30 people max office hours, and it will be the same people. If the rest of the class, which is 770 people, could do homework by themselves and get 100 100, the average grade for the class would be A+.\n\nTA and support review: 10/10. This was one of the classes where the TAs could explain every problem and teach you something.\n\nCS70: Discrete math and Stat are generally exciting subjects to me, but at Berkeley, man, why? Why does this class need to be so badly taught that understandable concepts are making 0 sense? Why are the lectures, hws and exams teaching/asking different concepts? The stat part is taught better than whatever is the first part of the class.\n\nCheating level in the class: 10/10. General advice for anyone is to pick a non-hw option and spend your time studying for the exams. Even if you look at the solutions, there is a minimal chance you may understand something unless you have someone who can explain it to you.\n\nTA and support review: I am unsure if the best TA knows what is happening in this class. If you go during office hours, TAs usually explain problems based on solutions. Lol. I could honestly just look it up myself if that's the help that I would need. Idk if the department is aware of it, but in the OH, they do a \"homework problems walkthrough\" where they give you 80% of the answers for the problems. If you stay in the office hours long enough, you can have all the solutions provided by the staff.\n\nCS160: Hear me out: \"If this class had enough seats, it would be one of the most popular classes at school.\" Do you know why? Because you actually feel like you are learning something that may benefit your career in the future. People want to learn material that could help them get a job, that can show them the different sides of CS, and that makes them fall in love with coding.\n\nCheating level in the class: 3/10 I think that there is no need to cheat. The class might be intense for someone and require a lot of learning, but I think the general atmosphere in the class is \"I am here to learn.\"\n\nTA and support review: Poor due to the budget, but also accessible if you need it. YouTube will be your best friend.\n\nCS161: One of the best exploration CS classes. Show you a different side of CS you may never experience alone.\n\nCheating level in the class: 4/10 may only help a little due to the nature of the projects.\n\nTA and support review: the most useless stuff ever. They can not look at your code; they can not help you to design, and they can only help you if you have no idea where to start (you can only ask specific questions like how I can ask something that I am confused about). Generally, TAs are good and know the subject, but I do not understand the point of the support if the only support you can get is \"general conceptual advice.\" They expect people to design the program but not teach how to do it.\n\nCS162 is a perfect class for anyone wanting to be SWE, but it is extremely time-consuming. The team is IMPORTANT. Please DO NOT take it with random people, or you may suffer twice as much.\n\nCheating level in the class: 1/10. It's hard to cheat since you have to be on the team, which is honestly why this class is so hard.\n\nTA and support review: TAs are great. In comparison to 161, they help you with design and code. Projects may have more directions. I have nothing to comment on outside of countless sleepless nights and the energy drink addiction that I developed.\n\nCS169A/L: This class has much potential, if not so poorly taught and disorganized. Probably the worst class in the entire CS series.\n\nCheating level in the class: 10/10. I suggest people cheat and take this class to fulfill the 5-upper div requirement. Even the non-CS concepts that they teach in the class are outdated. Maybe it was a good class in 2014, but not today. It could be easily replaced with 40 YouTube tutorials on modern website development, which would be more useful in real life.\n\nTA and support review: 0/10 When I took this class, only 1 TA out of 5 could actually help.\n\nCS170 is overkill for SWE. Taking CS169 and devoting time to studying leetcode and algorithms on the side will make you happier. I think the general temperature in the class can be described as \"What is going on?\"\n\nCheating level in the class: 10/10. I'm sorry to say, but when the homework does not make sense, it is the only thing people can do.\n\nTA and support review: Similar to CS70.\n\nCS186: I expected to learn about the system design rather than how to create the database from scratch.\n\nCheating level in the class: 8/10. I only give such a high rating because many people do not find projects interesting enough to spend time on.\n\nTA and support review: There should be a time limit for help, like 10 minutes or something, because most of the OH only have one TA precent. Class have the best exams I have ever taken at Berkeley since they test your knowledge of the class material. The class only needs a little support and could be taught remotely.\n\nCS188: The school offers this class only because they have to have classes. It may not be helpful for future job opportunities, but it is fun and interesting. The projects may make you feel like you are learning, and the math part is not bad.\n\ncheating level in the class: 11/10 - Similar to 16A/B series - for math part. 3/10 for the coding part.\n\nTA and support review: They are pretty great and know their stuff. There is not too much to say because I think the class is very well-balanced.\n\nCS189: I have mixed feelings about what I learn and how helpful it could be. Is this what ML is?\n\ncheating level in the class: 10/10. There is no way the average homework grade is 98/100 because everyone is a genius in this school. I feel like the coding part with no direction forces people to cheat. If you want people not to cheat, explain what they must do.\n\nTA and support review: TAs know their stuff and would help you with any problems. The coding part of homework may have a starter code and some directions.\n\nMy 5 cents about discussions: I would like discussion sections to have less silence time when people are forced to do the job on their own and more walkthrough style. I would like to see more logic in approaching problems.\n\nOverall cheating: people do not cheat because they are desperate or they do not want to learn, people do it simply because they do not feel like the time may worth it. Also I do believe that people cheat due to the luck of the direction and understanding of the material. Cheating is a big problem and I think its a fault of whoever is designing the class in the first place.\n\nOverall overview: I do not feel like the school has taught me a lot in terms of what I need to do at the workplace and contribute to my job search. Yes, some of the projects that i did might be impressive, but do they have a lot in common with the requirements for entry-level SWE jobs? No. That's the sad part. Almost everyone I know is studying on the side because they do not feel like they have any skills that are required for the job search.",

It should probably just end there.\n* Cal is probably the best choice for \"most\" people\n* Cal has carved itself a pretty good niche in the world of college admissions\n\nIf you wanna check it out, here's the original post: [https://collegesherpa.beehiiv.com/p/the-biggest-scam-in-higher-education](https://collegesherpa.beehiiv.com/p/the-biggest-scam-in-higher-education)\n\n# Why This School Should Probably Be A Top 3 School\n\n**While most schools chase prestige in single disciplines, UC Berkeley cracked the code on undergraduate ROI by being consistently second-best at everything**\n\nI'm sitting in a Palo Alto coffee shop next to two parents having the kind of conversation that makes you eavesdrop shamelessly.\n\n\"Harvard rejected Emma, but she got into Berkeley engineering,\" says one. \"I'm honestly relieved.\"\n\nThe other parent nearly chokes on her oat milk latte. \"Relieved? It's Berkeley.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but think about it. She'll probably switch majors twice, graduate debt-free, and still end up at Google. Meanwhile, Sarah\u2019s kid is studying classics at Harvard for $320,000.\"\n\nThat overheard conversation captures something fascinating happening in elite education. While parents obsess over getting their kids into schools that dominate specific rankings, UC Berkeley has quietly perfected a different game entirely.\n\n**The portfolio theory of college admissions**\n\nHere's Berkeley's not-so-secret weapon: they're not #1 at anything major, but they're consistently top 3 at everything.\n\nComputer science? #3 behind MIT and Stanford. Business? #3 behind Wharton and Stanford. Engineering? #3 behind MIT and Stanford. Psychology? #2 behind Harvard. The pattern holds across virtually every undergraduate program.\n\nThis sounds like a participation trophy strategy until you realize most 18-year-olds have no clue what they actually want to study. According to the Department of Education, 80% of students change their major at least once, and the average student changes majors three times.\n\nAt Harvard, switching from their #1-ranked economics program to their middle-tier engineering program feels like academic exile. At Berkeley, switching majors means moving from one top-3 program to another top-3 program.\n\n\"It's portfolio diversification applied to education,\" explains Dr. Sarah Chen, who studies higher education economics at Stanford (ironically). \"Berkeley accidentally created the index fund of universities.\"\n\n**The innovation breeding ground effect**\n\nBut Berkeley's real genius isn't in the rankings\u2014it's in the collision effect.\n\nWhen you're #1 at computer science, you attract the world's best computer science minds. When you're top 3 at everything, you attract the best minds from every field, and they all end up in the same dining halls, study groups, and weekend parties.\n\n\"I met my co-founder in a philosophy class, my lead engineer in an art history seminar, and my first investor at a poetry reading,\" says Maria Rodriguez, whose Berkeley-founded startup was acquired by Apple for $400M. \"That doesn't happen at specialized schools.\"\n\nThe numbers back this up. Berkeley undergraduate alumni have founded more companies valued at $1B+ than any other public university. They've also won more Nobel Prizes, started more nonprofits, and held more Fortune 500 CEO positions than graduates from schools with higher overall rankings.\n\n**The stealth wealth angle**\n\nThen there's the economics that make wealthy parents pause their Ivy League obsession.\n\nBerkeley's in-state tuition runs about $15,000 annually. Out-of-state hits $48,000\u2014still cheaper than most privates. But here's where it gets interesting: savvy families have discovered loopholes that would make tax attorneys proud.\n\nSome establish California residency through \"digital nomad\" programs. Others use Berkeley's satellite programs. A few leverage obscure scholarship programs tied to specific counties or professions.\n\n\"I know parents who've bought $200,000 condos in Oakland just to get their kids in-state tuition,\" says one educational consultant who requested anonymity. \"Do the math\u2014they save $120,000 over four years and end up with Bay Area real estate.\"\n\nMeanwhile, their kids get the same professors, research opportunities, and alumni networks as students paying full freight at comparable private schools.\n\n**The prestige paradox**\n\nThe final twist? Berkeley's \"second place\" strategy is creating a different kind of prestige.\n\nWhile Harvard graduates network within narrow alumni circles, Berkeley graduates populate every industry at every level. They're the CEOs hiring Harvard MBAs, the VCs funding Harvard entrepreneurs, and the professors teaching Harvard students.\n\n\"Berkeley doesn't produce the most exclusive graduates,\" notes education researcher Dr. James Wilson. \"They produce the most connected ones.\"\n\nThis shows up in unexpected ways. Berkeley alumni are more likely to hire from diverse schools, more likely to promote based on merit over pedigree, and more likely to challenge conventional wisdom\u2014probably because they've been doing it since freshman year.\n\nThat coffee shop conversation I overheard? The relieved parent was onto something. Sometimes being second-best at everything beats being first-best at anything.\n\nEspecially when \"everything\" includes the ability to think differently about what winning actually means.",

      "content": "I know some people are conflicted on whether or not to choose Berkeley. While I can't tailor advice to your specific circumstances, I'd like to share my experience in hopes that it could provide some insight. **To preface this, I graduated high school in 2019, and she graduated in 2020. We're both California residents.**\n\nMy sister and I had very different experiences. Since two high schools were available in our district, our parents let us choose. I went to a standard high school that had 6 classes a day. My sister went to the other one that had a block schedule, where you alternate between two sets of classes each day. For example, let's say on an A day you take Math, History, and English. The next day is a B day and you take Science, Spanish, and Art.\n\nI didn't get into Berkeley while in high school, so I went to San Diego State University. My sister got into Cal and UC Santa Barbara. We had toured most of the UC's (Cal, UCSB, UCLA, UCI, UCD, etc.) so we had an idea of their vibes and opportunities. While we were excited she got into Cal, she ultimately chose UCSB because she found it fit her personality better. The weather, beach, less stressful academic environment, etc. made it more appealing to her. (**For those unfamiliar with the UC system, keep in mind that Cal has a semester system and UCSB has a quarter system.**)\n\nIn high school, I initially wanted to do go to a school with a quarter system because I wanted to take a variety of classes. But when I went to SDSU and experienced the semester system, I quickly changed my mind. I found the pacing of the curriculum easy to handle (I majored in Microbiology), which helped make the transition to online classes less drastic when the pandemic happened. Since my sister had been used to the block schedule, the quarter system really stressed her out to the point where she switched her major to Communication (she originally majored in Nutrition before that). But to be fair, she started her first college year in the pandemic, so all of her classes her online from the get-go. When I started college, we switched to online in the second semester of my freshman year.\n\nBut even after switching her major, the fast-paced schedule at UCSB made it hard for her to connect with professors. While at SDSU, I managed to make up for the lost time towards the end of my academic career and salvage some letters of recommendation for grad school at Cal and got in. While I didn't have as many extracurriculars as I would have liked due to the pandemic, the semester schedule still gave me enough time and space to compensate for the gaps in my resume.\n\nThat's pretty much it to our stories. Some takeaways I think are worth noting are:\n\n\\- Keep in mind the type of school schedule you're used to right now because it can affect your adjustment to your college life, regardless if you're in a pandemic or not.\n\n\\- Your interests may change. Be open to different paths, especially because it's easier to change your major earlier in your academic career than later.\n\n\\- Consider the employment opportunities of the area surrounding your college. I know the market is tough right now, but I'd rather be in a competitive city with many opportunities than a non-competitive city that's barren.\n\n\\- Ask yourself if you see yourself living comfortably in the area you'll be in for the next 4 years. My sister got REALLY bored of living in Santa Barbara and wanted to get out. The allure of excitement and independence many college towns exude can fade quickly if you don't familiarize yourself enough with the area before moving to it.\n\nALSO, remember that our experiences were heavily impacted by the pandemic. Obviously things are really different now, so I don't want my story to be taken as gospel or overly cautionary. Feel free to ask any other questions.\n\nGood luck on your applications!",

I've already taken Calc 3, Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations through a local community college, but since I'm from out of state, it's a much more difficult process to see if my credits will count towards Math 53 & 54. Additionally, my advisor recommended that I take Math 53 since Berkeley math is a lot more difficult than community college math so it wouldn't necessarily be redundant to take a course I already know lots of the material from. \n\nHowever, after seeing that STEM courses have lecture and discussion times, I've realized that I don't want to take 3 STEM classes my first semester since it will make my schedule and workload super packed. Is it okay to only take 3 classes (ie. taking math H53, physics 5B, & theater in the fall, and then physics 89 the next semester), or should I replace one of the STEM classes I'm considering with another elective or breadth requirement?

The F and C came from a middle school course that transferred across three school districts in six months. Although I passed it on a pass/fail basis, the final school misrecorded the grades and refused to correct them despite documentation.\nAs for the W, I requested a drop before the deadline because the instructor had concealed being asked to resign from a prior position, was giving incorrect answers in lectures, and I had also become my brother\u2019s caretaker.

Holy shit he gave me an incomplete last minute\n Thank god cuz i just vomited some minutes ago. \n\nI was feeling pretty sick yesterday, had a lump in my throat and everything but I kinda ignore it and forge on my studying.\n\nThis morning I had Chem 3A and night I had Physics 8A. I was so sick, with headaches, nausea, fever, I was literally gagging and coughing during the exam. I wanted to just straight up leave during the Physics final because my head hurt too much. It was blinding pain. One of the questions I was doing I got confused on basic subtraction; I knew I didn't do well on this test which sucks because I did so well on the practice tests yesterday. I don't think its reflective of my grade because I'm so out of it.\n\nNow I have Math 1B tomorrow morning and I'm 4 lectures behind. Yeah I know it sucks but I made up 22 lectures this past week so I think I did all I could. I literally need to pull an allnighter to have any chance to ace this thing, but due to stress-induced insomnia I have frequently, last night I had 4 hours max of sleep. I'm not even a bad student, my midterm average for Math 1B is 138/150 which is pretty decent. I'm just lamenting that finals season just doesn't reflect what I really learned and put in the effort for. \n\nAnyways, I think I'm going to pass out, but to be honest I kinda value my grades a lot more than my health. Rant over, good luck with finals guys. ",

      "title": "After your last final at Berkeley",
      "content": "Yeah\u2026 everything after your last final at Berkeley just dissolves into this surreal, slow-motion blur. You sit there, finishing the last few questions, maybe in Wheeler, Dwinelle, or one of those cold, echoey rooms in Evans. You double-check your answers one last time, not because you need to, but because you don\u2019t want it to end just yet. Then you hand it in. That is your last exam at Berkeley. The last test you will ever take as a student here.\n\nYou step outside into the beautiful Berkeley sun, or maybe it\u2019s already night after a 7 to 10 p.m. final, and you stand there for a moment, not sure what to do. That is when it hits you. You are done. Not just with that exam, but with all of it. Every lecture you half-slept through. Every lab you dreaded. Every panicked night in Main Stacks. Every time you told yourself, just get through this week. It\u2019s all over.\n\nAnd there is no celebration. No moment that feels big enough. No one waiting for you. You just walk out, alone.\n\nYou wander around campus a bit, not because you need to, but because you cannot go home yet. Everything looks the same, but it no longer feels like yours. You pass by the Campanile. Maybe it\u2019s ringing. You used to find comfort in that sound. Now it just reminds you that time is still moving, even when you feel frozen. You are not headed to class. You are not meeting friends. You are not running late to a section you forgot about. You are just someone walking through a place that is starting to forget you.\n\nSproul is still full of life, but you are not one of them anymore. You move through the crowd like a ghost. You are invisible in the place that once made you feel seen. You pass buildings that hold too many memories in your freshman year. Dwinelle, with its endless hallways and its always-broken elevators. The way you used to get lost even in your junior year. The way it smelled like stress and old chalk and the way it held a hundred of your quiet, forgettable days. Wheeler, you can still picture where you used to sit. Which rows you claimed. Who sat beside you.\n\nMoffitt, more than just a library. It was a second home. You studied there. You cried there. You napped in chairs that were too uncomfortable and somehow still comforting. You watched the sun rise once, maybe twice, after staying all night for a final or midterm you thought would break you. You shared looks with your secret library crush across long tables... The ones that never turned into anything. The stranger you kept seeing on the fourth floor, always headphones in, lost in their own world. The two of you shared the same space, the same time, the same struggle, and maybe something else too. You never spoke. You always thought maybe next time. And then time ran out. They\u2019re gone now. Or maybe they\u2019re still here. Either way, that version of the story never got written. It lingers in your mind like a question you\u2019ll never answer. A softness that never became anything more.\n\nNow, those places feel like closed doors. Like the campus is gently but firmly telling you it is time to go. Not in anger, not in rejection, but because it has to keep going. And you are no longer part of that motion. And you know that the next time you come back, if you ever do, it will not be the same. The buildings you knew will change. Some will be torn down. Others will rise in their place, sleek and unfamiliar. Your old classrooms may be demolished, your favorite corners renovated. The people will be different. The energy will be younger. The world will move on without you, and Berkeley will too.\n\nThe glade will still be green. The sun will still set over the Bay with that soft orange glow. But you will not be running to class or waving to a friend or finding a spot on the lawn with your lunch. You will just be visiting. A stranger to the new students. A memory to the old ones. And no one will know what this place meant to you. No one will know where you used to sit or cry or laugh. No one will remember your version of Berkeley, because that version lived and ended with you.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nThen commencement week arrives. And it is supposed to be joyful. Everyone is in caps and gowns, families cheering, people crying and hugging in the stadium, trying to capture something that is already slipping away. You smile for the pictures. You laugh with friends. You go along with it, because that is what you are supposed to do. But inside, it feels like you are watching it all from far away. Like the moment is happening to someone else.\n\nYou try to feel proud. You try to feel excited. But mostly, you feel... nothing. Or too much, all at once. A strange mix of relief and emptiness, like you finally reached the end of a very long, very hard road, only to find yourself standing still. You thought it would feel different. You thought you would cry. Or feel something big. Instead, it all just feels quiet. Like you are floating through it. Like you are already starting to disappear.\n\nAt your department\u2019s ceremony at Greek Theatre, you sit surrounded by your classmates, people you shared lectures with, passed in hallways, maybe even shared late nights in the library with... and you realize this might be the first time you are hearing some of their names. You look around and see so many familiar faces, people you saw again and again over the years but never really knew. You shared time with them. four years of your life. And now they are walking across the stage, one by one, and you know this might be the last time you ever see them. You clap for them. You smile when your name is called. You walk the stage. You do everything right. But even as you do, there is a voice in the back of your mind asking quietly, is this really it? Four years. Hundreds of lectures. Thousands of hours. All those late nights. All that effort. And now you are just... done.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nAnd then you think of your friends. The ones you saw almost every day. The ones you studied with until 2 a.m. in Main Stacks or camped out with in the depressing reading rooms before finals. The ones you grabbed late-night boba with, sat with on the glade doing absolutely nothing. You might still have the same chat group. You might promise to visit, to FaceTime, to stay in touch. But deep down you know how life works. Everyone will leave. Everyone will start jobs, move to new cities, fly to new countries. People change. People drift. It might be years before you see some of them again. And for others, this might really be the last time. That thought sinks in quietly. But it stays. And it hurts.\n\nIt\u2019s time to pack. You roll up old posters. Fold clothes you wore to classes you forgot you ever took. You throw out lecture notes or cheat sheets you once thought you would keep forever. You look out your window one last time. The streets below are still alive, but you are already somewhere else in your mind. You take a walk down Telegraph or through Southside, past Raleigh\u2019s, past those little shops you never got around to visiting. Past the restaurants you always meant to try. And you realize that this version of Berkeley, the one you knew, only exists in your memory now.\n\nWhen you finally leave, it feels unreal. You think back to the first day you moved in. GBO Week, when everything felt too loud and too new. Your first lecture in a massive hall where you felt like no one would ever know your name. The first time you felt like you belonged. Your first fail midterm. Your first win. It all plays in your head like scenes from someone else\u2019s life. You do not know how to feel. Everything comes at once. You feel proud and empty. Grateful and afraid. Full of love for this place, and somehow hollow at the same time.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nAnd the hardest part?\n\nThere is no more routine. No more rushing out the door for your 8 a.m. in Wheeler, half-awake . No more sitting through back-to-back lectures in VLSB or Cory, trying to stay focused while your mind drifts. No more Canvas notifications reminding you of deadlines you already missed. No more waiting for office hours in crowded hallways, hoping a GSI can save your grade with one more regrade request. There is no more Gradescope eating your homework submission or telling you the deadline passed thirty seconds ago.\n\nNo more bCourses tabs left open for weeks, filled with lecture slides you promised you\u2019d review one day. And now, all of it... all those tabs, all those bookmarks... you quietly close them one by one. Just like that. The last traces of your academic life erased from your screen. There are no more meal swipes. No more grabbing boba with friends and running into someone you know.\n\nNo more waiting in line at Yali\u2019s or Raleigh\u2019s or peeking into MLK hoping to find an open table. No more sitting on the steps near Campanile as the sun sets behind golden gate bridge, watching the sky turn soft and golden, pretending the moment could last forever. No more borrowing mac chargers or frantically looking for outlets. No more pulling each other through finals with late-night La Burrita and quiet reassurances of \u201c*we\u2019ll be okay..*.\u201d\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\n**It hurts...** It is okay to feel numb. It is okay to feel lost. You are grieving something real, even if no one calls it that. This is not just the end of school. It is the end of a life you built from scratch. A version of you that only existed here, in this exact place, surrounded by the people and the moments that shaped you.\n\n**And if it still hurts**, it just means it mattered. It means you loved something deeply. It means Berkeley was never just a campus. It was a home. A place that held your laughter, your stress, your growth, your failures, your joy. A place that will never fully understand what it meant to you, but one that quietly witnessed your becoming.\n\n**So let it hurt.** Let yourself miss it. Take a slow walk through campus if you still can. Look at the Campanile one last time. Breathe in the late spring air. Say goodbye in whatever way feels right. And when it is time to leave, know that your version of Berkeley will live with you forever.\n\nYou are not alone in this sadness. Not now. Not ever.\n\nGo Bears. Always. >!(Fuck Stanford)!<\n\nClass of 2025! Thanks for taking the time to read all of this :'( it really means a lot. I know it\u2019s kind of a mess, just me trying to put scattered thoughts and feelings into words. I hope even a part of this resonated with you. Maybe save it and revisit it in a few weeks, or a few months. When things settle a bit, when the noise in your head quiets down, this might hit in a different way.",

      "title": "Let's Discuss Upcoming UCPD Encryption",
      "content": "For those who don\u2019t know me, I ran the ScanBerkeley account (@scanberkeley) while I was a student here (graduated in December 2023). *Not to be confused with The Berkeley Scanner (we\u2019re totally separate)*. ScanBerkeley was dedicated to monitoring and sharing urgent public safety info from UCPD, Berkeley PD, and Berkeley FD radio traffic. I wanted to post here about something that\u2019s about to impact public safety and transparency for everyone at UC Berkeley.\n\n  \nUCPD is now planning to encrypt their main dispatch radio channels along with most agencies around the East Bay. They \"claim\" this is required by a DOJ mandate regarding personal information. That is false. Units can run information via their vehicle computers (MDTs) and be in full compliance. They can use a second channel (which BPD already does). They can even \"break\" apart transmissions so information is not sent together, and still be in full compliance.\n\nHere is a section of the requirement to be in compliance: \n\n>\u201cEstablish policy to restrict dissemination of specific information that would provide for the protection of restricted CJI database information and combinations of name and other data elements that meet the definition of PII. This will provide for the protection of CJI and PII while allowing for radio traffic with the information necessary to provide public safety.\u201d\n\n\u00a0*(Source: California DOJ Information Bulletin, Confidentiality of CLETS Information, p. 2; FBI CJIS Security Policy Sections 5.10.1.2 & 5.13.1.1)*\n\n  \nWhy does this matter?\n\n* UCPD\u2019s real-time notification system has major issues. For years, WarnMe alerts have been vague, delayed, or missing critical context. If you\u2019ve ever received a generic \u201cpolice activity in the area\u201d message, you know how unhelpful that can be in a real emergency.\n* There have been many incidents where UCPD\u2019s official alerts excluded key descriptions like the suspect race, locations, etc. In many of these cases, I was able to provide that information within seconds of a dispatch, while the campus community waited hours (or never received an update) from official sources.\n* Open dispatch channels allow nearby police, fire, and emergency services (EOCs) to stay aware of ongoing incidents and respond more effectively. Full encryption makes cross-agency coordination harder, slows down emergency responses, and ultimately undermines community safety. *(FUN FACT: Campus staff/response personnel even used my tweets during an active incident once because PD took so long to tell them. Will key staff get encrypted radio access? Doubt it.)*\n\n\n\nWhat about officer safety? What if criminals are listening?\n\nWhile this is a valid worry in certain tactical situations, most agencies already handle sensitive operations on separate encrypted tactical channels, keeping the main dispatch open for routine calls. In practice, general dispatch rarely includes the kind of information that would compromise officer safety, and any critical details can be quickly moved to a secure channel if needed. It\u2019s also important to understand that even with full voice encryption, the control channels used by digital radio systems remain unencrypted. These control channels still reveal which radio IDs are active, which talkgroups are being used, and when units are transmitting. With the right tools and some research, someone could still monitor patterns and activity.\n\n\n\nFinal argument, IT IS ALL PUBLIC RECORDS! Anyone can request the audio. All this changes is some intern will likely need to go redact small portions of the radio traffic. Only major issue with this, is UC Berkeley's public records takes months to return. (I am still waiting for some from 2 years ago).\n\n\n\nThanks to a city council resolution, **Berkeley PD is required to keep their primary dispatch open to the public.** ([https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2021-09-28%20Item%2018%20Lease%20Agreement%20with%20Motorola%20-%20Supp%20Harrison.pdf](https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2021-09-28%20Item%2018%20Lease%20Agreement%20with%20Motorola%20-%20Supp%20Harrison.pdf)) There are no current plans to encrypt the fire department radio traffic. UCPD is not subject to these restrictions. To be clear, TAC channels should be encrypted. Tactical incidents can always be moved to a secondary channel. I am only pushing for dispatch to remain open.\n\n\n\nIf you care about this, now is the time to speak up. Contact the Chancellor, ASUC, UCPD Accountability Board, and tell them you want UCPD to keep dispatch channels open like Berkeley PD will be doing. Anyway, happy to discuss more below. :)",

I received a letter saying that my health plan had been changed to one in Alameda County, which I didn't anticipate since I lived in San Francisco County and have no issue with accessing them during the school year. \n\nThen, I went to the Alameda Social Office to see what the issue was. They said that my MediCal case is still managed in San Francisco, and likely it's your address that's been changed, so your health plan got reassigned. Since I am the type of person who is afraid of asking for help so I tried to resolve this by myself. Obviously, it wasn't successful, so I finally decided to reach out for support. I filled out the BNC Assistance Form, and a coordinator reached out to reassure me that it is acceptable to have CalFresh benefits in one county while having MediCal benefits in your home county (Since you're living in Alameda temporarily for school). \n\nMy advice for everyone is **always** to look out for support; they have more knowledge dealing with this issue than you, and they will better assist your situation.

      "content": "For those who don\u2019t know me, I ran the ScanBerkeley account (@scanberkeley) while I was a student here (graduated in December 2023). *Not to be confused with The Berkeley Scanner (we\u2019re totally separate)*. ScanBerkeley was dedicated to monitoring and sharing urgent public safety info from UCPD, Berkeley PD, and Berkeley FD radio traffic. I wanted to post here about something that\u2019s about to impact public safety and transparency for everyone at UC Berkeley.\n\n  \nUCPD is now planning to encrypt their main dispatch radio channels along with most agencies around the East Bay. They \"claim\" this is required by a DOJ mandate regarding personal information. That is false. Units can run information via their vehicle computers (MDTs) and be in full compliance. They can use a second channel (which BPD already does). They can even \"break\" apart transmissions so information is not sent together, and still be in full compliance.\n\nHere is a section of the requirement to be in compliance: \n\n>\u201cEstablish policy to restrict dissemination of specific information that would provide for the protection of restricted CJI database information and combinations of name and other data elements that meet the definition of PII. This will provide for the protection of CJI and PII while allowing for radio traffic with the information necessary to provide public safety.\u201d\n\n\u00a0*(Source: California DOJ Information Bulletin, Confidentiality of CLETS Information, p. 2; FBI CJIS Security Policy Sections 5.10.1.2 & 5.13.1.1)*\n\n  \nWhy does this matter?\n\n* UCPD\u2019s real-time notification system has major issues. For years, WarnMe alerts have been vague, delayed, or missing critical context. If you\u2019ve ever received a generic \u201cpolice activity in the area\u201d message, you know how unhelpful that can be in a real emergency.\n* There have been many incidents where UCPD\u2019s official alerts excluded key descriptions like the suspect race, locations, etc. In many of these cases, I was able to provide that information within seconds of a dispatch, while the campus community waited hours (or never received an update) from official sources.\n* Open dispatch channels allow nearby police, fire, and emergency services (EOCs) to stay aware of ongoing incidents and respond more effectively. Full encryption makes cross-agency coordination harder, slows down emergency responses, and ultimately undermines community safety. *(FUN FACT: Campus staff/response personnel even used my tweets during an active incident once because PD took so long to tell them. Will key staff get encrypted radio access? Doubt it.)*\n\n\n\nWhat about officer safety? What if criminals are listening?\n\nWhile this is a valid worry in certain tactical situations, most agencies already handle sensitive operations on separate encrypted tactical channels, keeping the main dispatch open for routine calls. In practice, general dispatch rarely includes the kind of information that would compromise officer safety, and any critical details can be quickly moved to a secure channel if needed. It\u2019s also important to understand that even with full voice encryption, the control channels used by digital radio systems remain unencrypted. These control channels still reveal which radio IDs are active, which talkgroups are being used, and when units are transmitting. With the right tools and some research, someone could still monitor patterns and activity.\n\n\n\nFinal argument, IT IS ALL PUBLIC RECORDS! Anyone can request the audio. All this changes is some intern will likely need to go redact small portions of the radio traffic. Only major issue with this, is UC Berkeley's public records takes months to return. (I am still waiting for some from 2 years ago).\n\n\n\nThanks to a city council resolution, **Berkeley PD is required to keep their primary dispatch open to the public.** ([https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2021-09-28%20Item%2018%20Lease%20Agreement%20with%20Motorola%20-%20Supp%20Harrison.pdf](https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2021-09-28%20Item%2018%20Lease%20Agreement%20with%20Motorola%20-%20Supp%20Harrison.pdf)) There are no current plans to encrypt the fire department radio traffic. UCPD is not subject to these restrictions. To be clear, TAC channels should be encrypted. Tactical incidents can always be moved to a secondary channel. I am only pushing for dispatch to remain open.\n\n\n\nIf you care about this, now is the time to speak up. Contact the Chancellor, ASUC, UCPD Accountability Board, and tell them you want UCPD to keep dispatch channels open like Berkeley PD will be doing. Anyway, happy to discuss more below. :)",

      "content": "I\u2019ll be starting a PhD at Berkeley soon, and I\u2019m choosing among three apartment options. I know that there are tradeoffs for all of these options, and ultimately only I can weigh them, but if people with experience as a PhD student and/or experience living off-campus in Berkeley can give their two cents, that could help a lot! To add some context, I\u2019m an avid cyclist so that\u2019s how I plan to get around. I value urban living (I know Berkeley is more  \u2018dense suburban\u2019 in much of the city) in that I like being decently close to at least a few cafes and restaurants. And a bar, ideally. It would be great to not have to share stuff with too many roommates \u2014 I currently live in a tight four-bed, and kitchen space has been a source of frustration (though not conflict) from time to time. I\u2019d also love to not have to share a bathroom with too many people. \n\nIt would also be helpful to know if these rents are reasonable for their locations. In the city I\u2019m coming from, I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at sniffing out when a place is overpriced. I\u2019m pretty okay with living a bit farther from campus to pay less\u2014again, I\u2019m an avid cyclist and I\u2019m pretty confident that I can get around easily that way. \n\n**Option 1:** I can pay $1145/month to live about 1.5 miles west of campus in a decently sized furnished room with a private bathroom and four roommates. But it\u2019s farther from cafes, restaurants and bars, as well as a mile from BART. I\u2019d also have to walk about a mile to get to any grocery store. \n\n**Option 2:** I can pay $1225/month to live about 1.8 miles from campus in a huge furnished room with two roommates, one bathroom, and no dishwasher. I\u2019d be 5 minutes from BART and walking distance to numerous bars, restaurants, and grocery stores. It\u2019s right by the Oakland border and close-ish to Temescal/Bushrod, so my guess is it isn\u2019t near tons of undergrads but idk. My pause is that I\u2019d be sharing the bathroom with two other people. \n\n**Option 3:** I can pay $1500/month to live about 2.3 miles in a studio in Temescal (Oakland). It would be unfurnished. It\u2019d be very close to a few grocery stores and about a 15 minute walk from BART. My pause is that this is significantly pricier than every other option, and the PhD stipend at Berkeley is very good as far as stipends go, but it\u2019s not high. I\u2019d be spending 38% of my pre-tax income on rent. ",

There\u2019s no living room, but the location is great and the space is really functional for two people.

We\u2019ve got folks signing up from a wide range of industries including tech, consulting, automotive, real estate, finance, legal, AI, and aerospace.\n\nSome of the companies we have so far: **Anthropic, Apple, Astranis, NVIDIA, SpaceX, Salesforce, Accenture, Lyft, and ServiceNow, and many more**. Super excited about the mix of alumni coming in. If you\u2019re a Bear and want to help (or get help), this is really starting to come together\n\nBerkeley email verification system on Discord is now set up, and the Discord server has been officially created.

Once that is in place, we\u2019ll open it up to students and new grads. Stay tuned! \n\n \\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nJust wanted to post a quick update because\u2026 wow. It seems like a lot of people are interested in this idea, and honestly, the response has been amazing. We\u2019ve officially gotten the green light to go ahead, and we\u2019re going to start rolling this out soon (Green light really just means a few of us (Cal Bears) agreed to spend our weekend working on this... we all have full-time jobs after all)...\n\n**First step: pulling together a  crew of alumni who are down to help with resume reviews and job referrals.**\n\nIf you're a Cal grad working in tech, consulting, finance, biotech, or **really anywhere**, and you remember how much the job hunt sucked... we\u2019d love to have you on board.

That endless loop of cold DMs, ignored applications and interviews, and awkward coffee chats that go nowhere?\n* **Worst case? You get laid off one day... and now you\u2019ve got this Discord at your back. Layoffs are brutal and random. But when it happens, you\u2019ll already be plugged into a network of Bears who\u2019ve got your back and give you referrals, ready to return the favor. You helped them, and they\u2019ll help you**\n* Someone probably helped you...  this is your chance to pay it forward\n* You can make a real difference in under few minutes a week... Skim a resume or Drop a referral on your lunch break or boring meetings. That\u2019s it\n* Referring or giving honest feedback to Berkeley students can change their entire career\n* You can stay totally anonymous if you want in the discord\n* You\u2019ll wish this existed when you were job hunting. This is what we all needed back then \u2014 and now we get to build it.\n* You\u2019ll never get a cold LinkedIn DM here. **No \u201cHi, hope you\u2019re doing well\u2026\u201d nonsense.** That energy is dead.\n* This isn\u2019t some corporate career group.

Say \u201cyour resume sucks and needs work\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t refer you yet\u201d ... that kind of honesty is more valuable than any coffee chat.\n* You were lost, stressed, and under-qualified once too. Don't forget what it felt like to need a hand and not know where to ask.\n* You don\u2019t have to be a  career coach, just be a human who remembers the grind.\n* No one's selling anything. It\u2019s literally just a bunch of Cal students and grads trying to make job hunting suck less\n* It\u2019s Berkeley-only (No randoms from the internet)\n* You\u2019re probably already scrolling Discord or Reddit during work anyway\n\nLet\u2019s be honest... we all know the Berkeley Career Center is barely helpful for most students and for you. You wait a week to meet with some random career advisor who\u2019s never worked in tech, finance, or literally any industry you're applying to. They give you a generic resume template and tell you to \u201cCheck Handshake\u201d or \u201cApply on LinkedIn.\u201d Career fairs?

      "title": "Shame on ASUC Latine Senators for their Silence!!",
      "content": "So I'm from South LA and we're in an honest to god war-zone right now. I've seen people get detained mere blocks from me, neighbors and friends are going missing, and fear has genuinely gripped the entirety of LA. And the absolute silence of everyone ASUC until today, day SIX of the raids, absolutely sickens me. While there were a few sporadic posts beforehand, no one actually shared anything until day FOUR of the raids?? HELLO? And absolutely nothing on the illegal detainment and release of SEIU President David Huerta because oh yeah, that historic inter-community organizing happened before day 6 so I guess it doesn't count... \n\nAnyway I opened Instagram today and after the forcible arrest of Sen. Alex Padilla, everyoneee ASUC started actually posting. Let's ignore that half of them probably want to intern with him, why would they wait so long? I saw so many of them posting aesthetic dc and hilltern pics literal hours before so did they coordinate to all post on the same day? And if so, why go through all the effort to only post a copy-paste know your rights template we've all seen floating around since January??? Key word is ONLY because yes know-your-rights should also be shared but... really? We elected you and this is the absolute most you can come up with? Yes I know, everyone ASUC is at a DC or Sacramento internship (wonder how they got that role...) but Latine ASUC-elected officials specifically ran on immigration as their key platform. Every. Single. One. Of. Them. So why wait until day SIX to actually post ANYTHING, the barest freaking minimum!!! I have data-science friends posting and organizing more than anyone ASUC and they don't even like leaving their house! I literally work 8 hours a day and still MAKE time to stay informed, spread the word, and check in on my Paramount family because yes, it's also still horrible there.  \n\n  \nAnyway I didn't write this to completely trash on the ASUC because there's still organizing work to be done for the greater community of immigrants, Californians, and average Americans whose rights are being unconstitutionally infringed upon. And they come first, always. I write this with the slim hope that a single human being reads this and maybe we can stop only seeing copy-paste know your rights templates and the same 3 Berkeley-area/Norcal specific immigration resources. Because that's such a waste of a huge social network that could actually make a difference. Here are the ideas me and my full-time employed friends have come up with:\n\n\\- Repost/share in an IG slideshow GoFundmes for ICE Raid victims or even fellow Berkeley Bears who've lost a family member and need help with legal fees. (Trust me, they're out there)\n\n\\- Follow area-specific immigration nonprofits in areas OUTSIDE of Berkeley.... because Bears exist everywhere in California. I've seen 5 different non profits post different, detailed, pro-bono immigration centers/lawyer lists on Instagram alone. The only work you'd have to do is repost the slideshow page or, if you absolutely can't live without the credit, copy paste it into a canva template and hit share. \n\n\\- Ask your LA friends about community-specific ICE incidents and repost their stories. 2 US Citizen highschool seniors were taken last friday and no one outside of my neighborhood is posting about it!! And today a Latina valedictorian was giving her graduation speech in Spanish and she was physically ATTACKED by a Karen mom in the audience and the principal did nothing!! Again nothing in the news but that happened to a highschool 20 minutes from me!! REACH OUT TO YOUR LA AND PARAMOUNT PEOPLE. So many stories are being suppressed. \n\n\\- POST ABOUT NO KINGS DAY PROTESTS!! Helloooo they're happening everywhere in the country and I've seen so many individual posts about it, I'm sure you can find 3 about the SF, LA, and Oakland area ones. \n\n\\- Part 2 of No Kings Day, just post about related protests. My friend just went to a Oaxacan press conference in DTLA when she's not even Mexican. We need to reach across divides now more than ever. And that takes more than a few empty but actual action. (Social media is a good start) \n\n\\- Just write a 5-minute letter. I saw 2 ASUC people do this and it was sweet, at the very least show that you're educated and engaged. \n\n\\- Linktrees. Everyone has linktrees, I like that just keep it updated. Kris Jenner would say \"you're doing amazing sweetie!!!!!\" \n\n\\- There's more but I need to make dinner and this isn't my job. I just need Berkeley to set an example because UCLA is pitch quiet right now even though there are officers stationed in Westwood. \n\n  \nMaybe these ideas are against some obsecure ASUC rule that has no real impact on the world. I don't know. But that's what personal social media accounts are for and if someone was elected, they have to have more than a single follower. So yeah. And if you just ran for ASUC to get some DC internships just say so because I'm getting tired. My friends are tired. My community is hurting deep. And I need to know if I'll side eye you at the Yopo line or not. Again this is said with no malicious intent, I'm just frustrated and need the ASUC to be held accountable. Please change, the fight is still ongoing and we need all the support we can get. ",

      "content": "I know some people are conflicted on whether or not to choose Berkeley. While I can't tailor advice to your specific circumstances, I'd like to share my experience in hopes that it could provide some insight. **To preface this, I graduated high school in 2019, and she graduated in 2020. We're both California residents.**\n\nMy sister and I had very different experiences. Since two high schools were available in our district, our parents let us choose. I went to a standard high school that had 6 classes a day. My sister went to the other one that had a block schedule, where you alternate between two sets of classes each day. For example, let's say on an A day you take Math, History, and English. The next day is a B day and you take Science, Spanish, and Art.\n\nI didn't get into Berkeley while in high school, so I went to San Diego State University. My sister got into Cal and UC Santa Barbara. We had toured most of the UC's (Cal, UCSB, UCLA, UCI, UCD, etc.) so we had an idea of their vibes and opportunities. While we were excited she got into Cal, she ultimately chose UCSB because she found it fit her personality better. The weather, beach, less stressful academic environment, etc. made it more appealing to her. (**For those unfamiliar with the UC system, keep in mind that Cal has a semester system and UCSB has a quarter system.**)\n\nIn high school, I initially wanted to do go to a school with a quarter system because I wanted to take a variety of classes. But when I went to SDSU and experienced the semester system, I quickly changed my mind. I found the pacing of the curriculum easy to handle (I majored in Microbiology), which helped make the transition to online classes less drastic when the pandemic happened. Since my sister had been used to the block schedule, the quarter system really stressed her out to the point where she switched her major to Communication (she originally majored in Nutrition before that). But to be fair, she started her first college year in the pandemic, so all of her classes her online from the get-go. When I started college, we switched to online in the second semester of my freshman year.\n\nBut even after switching her major, the fast-paced schedule at UCSB made it hard for her to connect with professors. While at SDSU, I managed to make up for the lost time towards the end of my academic career and salvage some letters of recommendation for grad school at Cal and got in. While I didn't have as many extracurriculars as I would have liked due to the pandemic, the semester schedule still gave me enough time and space to compensate for the gaps in my resume.\n\nThat's pretty much it to our stories. Some takeaways I think are worth noting are:\n\n\\- Keep in mind the type of school schedule you're used to right now because it can affect your adjustment to your college life, regardless if you're in a pandemic or not.\n\n\\- Your interests may change. Be open to different paths, especially because it's easier to change your major earlier in your academic career than later.\n\n\\- Consider the employment opportunities of the area surrounding your college. I know the market is tough right now, but I'd rather be in a competitive city with many opportunities than a non-competitive city that's barren.\n\n\\- Ask yourself if you see yourself living comfortably in the area you'll be in for the next 4 years. My sister got REALLY bored of living in Santa Barbara and wanted to get out. The allure of excitement and independence many college towns exude can fade quickly if you don't familiarize yourself enough with the area before moving to it.\n\nALSO, remember that our experiences were heavily impacted by the pandemic. Obviously things are really different now, so I don't want my story to be taken as gospel or overly cautionary. Feel free to ask any other questions.\n\nGood luck on your applications!",

You\u2019ll:\n\n* Submit your resume\n* Get it reviewed by someone who's been in your shoes\n* Get referred when your resume\u2019s in good shape\n\nThis is **not** a spammy job board. It\u2019s 1-on-1 discord help.\n\n**Stage 3: Structured Roles + Submission System**  \nWe\u2019ll build out some simple structure:\n\n* Resume Reviewers (alumni volunteers)\n* Referral Leads (people who actually submit referrals internally or submit directly to recruiters, not just a social job link)\n* Submission queue with deadlines (e.g., 72-hour review turnaround)\n\n**Why This Matters**\n\nThere are so many alumni who *would* help if someone just asked... but most students never do. They don\u2019t know how, or it feels awkward. This fixes that. It\u2019s all about making help **easy to ask for** and **easy to give**. No weird LinkedIn DM, no waiting three weeks for someone to \u201ccircle back.\u201d\n\nAnd let\u2019s be real \u2014 **f\\*ck cold LinkedIn DMs and coffee chats.**\n\nNo one wants to hop on a \u201cquick 15-minute coffee chat\u201d after a full day of work or meeting just to talk in circles and pretend we\u2019re networking. Both alumni and students are tired. This is for people who want to cut the fluff and actually help each other get jobs \u2014 fast.\n\nEveryone in the server will be [**berkeley.edu**](http://berkeley.edu) **verified**. No randos. Just a chill, focused space where Berkeley students and grads can connect, review resumes fast, drop referrals fast, and move on with their lives.\n\nAnd yeah, it\u2019s 100% free. The only rule? If you get a job (through this thing or not), you have to come back and help the next Bear. Review a resume. Drop a referral. Keep the cycle going. No excuses. No freeloaders. Just a low-key referral cult built on good karma and getting sh\\*t done.\n\nNot sure yet which industries we'll focus on... honestly just seeing who shows up first. Could start with tech, but if we get folks from consulting, finance, biotech, etc., we\u2019ll adapt. Totally depends on the mix of grads who want to help.\n\n# Interested?\n\n# Alum: If you\u2019re down to review a few resumes and keep refer someone now and then, drop a comment or DM me. Doesn\u2019t have to be a big time commitment.\n\nStudents/New Grads: If this sounds like something you\u2019d join once it\u2019s live, plese upvote this post... I\u2019ll slowly roll out invites once we\u2019re ready and have enough folks who can help.\n\nP.S. We're the same people who started the Free Food@Berkeley Discord in 2022, which turned out to be pretty successful... That was fun, now we\u2019re just looking to build something new that\u2019s actually useful. Hope you'll be part of it.

I have a couple questions because I'm kind of unsure whether I should transfer.\n\nFor context, I want to go into SWE, and I already have a SWE internship at a FAANG company. I applied to Berkeley because I like the location (I'm from the Bay originally) and I thought it'd have a stronger brand name for tech/engineering. I know a lot of Berkeley students start startups, there's more on-campus tech recruiting, more access to company events and hackathons etc, which is something I like because Vanderbilt doesn't have much of a tech culture and our brand name in engineering is kind of weak.\n\nHowever, some of my friends have told me it's not worth to transfer to be a stats major and that it won't look good for tech recruiting. I don't really want to transfer if it won't substantially help my career in the long run because I like Vanderbilt, have a lot of friends here, and have landed my first internship already.\n\nSo, my most important question is, how easy would it be to switch to a CS or DS major as I\u2019m already within CDSS?

That said, I\u2019m not super strong with stats, so I was hesitant about DS, but I\u2019ve heard from transfer friends that you can still take a lot of CS classes anyway.\n\nI feel like I could thrive more at a private school, but Columbia just isn\u2019t known for CS, and I\u2019m not sure if staying is worth it.\n\nWould love any thoughts from CS/DS majors at Berkeley.

It should probably just end there.\n* Cal is probably the best choice for \"most\" people\n* Cal has carved itself a pretty good niche in the world of college admissions\n\nIf you wanna check it out, here's the original post: [https://collegesherpa.beehiiv.com/p/the-biggest-scam-in-higher-education](https://collegesherpa.beehiiv.com/p/the-biggest-scam-in-higher-education)\n\n# Why This School Should Probably Be A Top 3 School\n\n**While most schools chase prestige in single disciplines, UC Berkeley cracked the code on undergraduate ROI by being consistently second-best at everything**\n\nI'm sitting in a Palo Alto coffee shop next to two parents having the kind of conversation that makes you eavesdrop shamelessly.\n\n\"Harvard rejected Emma, but she got into Berkeley engineering,\" says one. \"I'm honestly relieved.\"\n\nThe other parent nearly chokes on her oat milk latte. \"Relieved? It's Berkeley.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but think about it. She'll probably switch majors twice, graduate debt-free, and still end up at Google. Meanwhile, Sarah\u2019s kid is studying classics at Harvard for $320,000.\"\n\nThat overheard conversation captures something fascinating happening in elite education. While parents obsess over getting their kids into schools that dominate specific rankings, UC Berkeley has quietly perfected a different game entirely.\n\n**The portfolio theory of college admissions**\n\nHere's Berkeley's not-so-secret weapon: they're not #1 at anything major, but they're consistently top 3 at everything.\n\nComputer science? #3 behind MIT and Stanford. Business? #3 behind Wharton and Stanford. Engineering? #3 behind MIT and Stanford. Psychology? #2 behind Harvard. The pattern holds across virtually every undergraduate program.\n\nThis sounds like a participation trophy strategy until you realize most 18-year-olds have no clue what they actually want to study. According to the Department of Education, 80% of students change their major at least once, and the average student changes majors three times.\n\nAt Harvard, switching from their #1-ranked economics program to their middle-tier engineering program feels like academic exile. At Berkeley, switching majors means moving from one top-3 program to another top-3 program.\n\n\"It's portfolio diversification applied to education,\" explains Dr. Sarah Chen, who studies higher education economics at Stanford (ironically). \"Berkeley accidentally created the index fund of universities.\"\n\n**The innovation breeding ground effect**\n\nBut Berkeley's real genius isn't in the rankings\u2014it's in the collision effect.\n\nWhen you're #1 at computer science, you attract the world's best computer science minds. When you're top 3 at everything, you attract the best minds from every field, and they all end up in the same dining halls, study groups, and weekend parties.\n\n\"I met my co-founder in a philosophy class, my lead engineer in an art history seminar, and my first investor at a poetry reading,\" says Maria Rodriguez, whose Berkeley-founded startup was acquired by Apple for $400M. \"That doesn't happen at specialized schools.\"\n\nThe numbers back this up. Berkeley undergraduate alumni have founded more companies valued at $1B+ than any other public university. They've also won more Nobel Prizes, started more nonprofits, and held more Fortune 500 CEO positions than graduates from schools with higher overall rankings.\n\n**The stealth wealth angle**\n\nThen there's the economics that make wealthy parents pause their Ivy League obsession.\n\nBerkeley's in-state tuition runs about $15,000 annually. Out-of-state hits $48,000\u2014still cheaper than most privates. But here's where it gets interesting: savvy families have discovered loopholes that would make tax attorneys proud.\n\nSome establish California residency through \"digital nomad\" programs. Others use Berkeley's satellite programs. A few leverage obscure scholarship programs tied to specific counties or professions.\n\n\"I know parents who've bought $200,000 condos in Oakland just to get their kids in-state tuition,\" says one educational consultant who requested anonymity. \"Do the math\u2014they save $120,000 over four years and end up with Bay Area real estate.\"\n\nMeanwhile, their kids get the same professors, research opportunities, and alumni networks as students paying full freight at comparable private schools.\n\n**The prestige paradox**\n\nThe final twist? Berkeley's \"second place\" strategy is creating a different kind of prestige.\n\nWhile Harvard graduates network within narrow alumni circles, Berkeley graduates populate every industry at every level. They're the CEOs hiring Harvard MBAs, the VCs funding Harvard entrepreneurs, and the professors teaching Harvard students.\n\n\"Berkeley doesn't produce the most exclusive graduates,\" notes education researcher Dr. James Wilson. \"They produce the most connected ones.\"\n\nThis shows up in unexpected ways. Berkeley alumni are more likely to hire from diverse schools, more likely to promote based on merit over pedigree, and more likely to challenge conventional wisdom\u2014probably because they've been doing it since freshman year.\n\nThat coffee shop conversation I overheard? The relieved parent was onto something. Sometimes being second-best at everything beats being first-best at anything.\n\nEspecially when \"everything\" includes the ability to think differently about what winning actually means.",

      "title": "General Insights regarding Alum email and CalNet account after graduation (2025)",
      "content": "I posted this comment under someone\u2019s question but they deleted their post. I\u2019m sharing again since it might be helpful. \n\nThis should apply to both undergrad and grad students who graduate from Cal in 2025 (at least). Btw, the Alumni Email Service (google search alumni email service bconnected) should be the most updated place to go to since the policy has been changed a bit during a couple of years. \n\n0. Eligibility for an alum email: check Alumni Email Service page\n\n1. CalNet account vs Berkeley email address:\n\nCalNet account includes info about your UID, CalNet ID (ie. the username of the CalNet account), student ID, Berkeley email address, affiliations, etc. You could check info about your CalNet account on CalNet Account Manager dashboard via mycalnet.berkeley.edu\n\nYou could say that your Berkeley email is a part of your CalNet account and it\u2019s the thing that you still have access to even if your CalNet account expired (you don\u2019t need to fill out any form to claim your alum email INITIALLY, but you need to follow the instructions from \u201cAlumni Email Service\u201d to MAINTAIN it after graduation).\n\n2. Grace period and access to Berkeley services/apps and third-party apps:\nAfter you graduate, at some point, you will receive an email informing you that your active student/employee affiliation has terminated and you have entered the grace period. During this grace period, you will still have access to a lot of applications/services on campus (google search grace period at berkeley to see more info). So you can use this time period to transfer any data needed from those services/applications to somewhere you still have access to (ie. your personal google account, external drive, computer, etc).\n\nThe applications I mentioned do not include Microsoft 365, Adobe, etc. For such 3rd party applications that you are granted free access as a registered student\u2014since you graduate, you will become not-registered student at some point\u2014and that prevents you from accessing such apps. So for this case, I would recommend to transfer data (from Adode, Microsoft, etc) before you actually graduate. You could check what apps you are eligible for from \u201cSoftware Eligibility\u201d (google search the term).\n\nAt certain points during your grace period, you might receive some emails like \u201cYour CalNet account is expiring in 3months/2weeks/etc.\u201d If so, this kind of emails is to list what services/apps you won\u2019t have access anymore after your grace period ends (for example: CalCentral, bCourses, etc). It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t have access to Berkeley email anymore.\n\nWhat I mean is, that even after the grace period, you still have access to your Berkeley email (because in the latest policy, you don\u2019t need to fill out any form to claim your alum email account) as long as you follow the activity requirement in Alumni Email Service to keep your alum email after graduation.\n\n3. the 5gb requirement:\nThis requirement is for the overall storage of your bConnected Google account (which includes your Berkeley email). You need to keep it below 5gb. Or else, after grace period, you will be unable to send/receive emails outside of @berkeley.edu domain.\n3.1. So is that ok if I have over 5gb during grace period? Yeah, even if you exceed 5gb in your overall storage, you can still send/receive emails outside of @berkeley.edu DURING the grace period. But you should use this time to transfer data to keep it below 5gb instead of waiting until last minutes. It\u2019s very time consuming.\n\n4. How to keep your CalNet account from expiring?\ncoming back to Cal to take classes, or becoming a staff/faculty is one of the ways to prevent your CalNet account from expiring. But I\u2019m sure what most people care about after graduation is keeping the email rather than the CalNet account.\n\np/s feel free to add on or update any info you know",

His Substack includes a post titled \u201cThe Curious Case of Matt Gaetz: How the Deep State Destroys Its Enemies,\u201d as well as another titled \u201cPete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense: The Warrior Washington Fears.\u201d\n\n**Akash Bobba** has attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he was in the prestigious Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology program. According to a copy of his now-deleted LinkedIn obtained by WIRED, he was an investment engineering intern at the Bridgewater Associates hedge fund as of last spring, and previously an intern at both Meta and Palantir. He was a featured guest on a since-deleted podcast with Aman Manazir, an engineer who interviews engineers about how they landed their dream jobs, where he\u00a0[talked about those experiences last June](https://podtail.com/podcast/lift-off-with-aman-manazir/-3-my-secret-system-for-landing-a-meta-internship-/).\n\nBoth Bobba and Coristine are listed in internal OPM records reviewed by WIRED as \u201cexperts\u201d at OPM, reporting directly to Amanda Scales, its new chief of staff. Scales previously worked on talent for xAI, Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company, and as part of Uber\u2019s talent acquisition team, per LinkedIn. Employees at GSA tell WIRED that Coristine has appeared on calls where workers were made to go over code they had written and justify their jobs. WIRED\u00a0[previously reported](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-tech-workers-gsa-tts/)\u00a0that Coristine was added to call with GSA staff members using a non-government Gmail address. Employees were not given an explanation as to who he was or why he was on the calls.\n\nSources tell WIRED that Bobba, Coristine, Farritor, and Shaotran all currently have working GSA emails and A-suite level clearance at the GSA, which means that they work out of the agency\u2019s top floor and have access to all physical spaces and IT systems, according a source with knowledge of the GSA\u2019s clearance protocols. The source, who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity because they fear retaliation, says they worry that the new teams could bypass the regular security clearance protocols to access the agency\u2019s sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF), as the\u00a0[Trump administration has already granted temporary security clearances](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/politics/trump-temporary-security-clearances/index.html)\u00a0to unvetted people.\n\nThis is in addition to Coristine and Bobba being listed as \u201cexperts\u201d working at OPM. Bednar says that while staff can be loaned out between agencies for special projects or to work on issues that might cross agency lines, it\u2019s not exactly common practice.",

The place was also very pretty and loved how dishes and cups were used for dine in. I will be coming back and this place is definitely on top of my favorites list :)\n\nAfterwards I went with my friend to eat Cream and he recommended the ice cream sandwich \n\nI got an oatmeal cookie that had dried cranberries, apples, and pumpkin seeds and paired it with a green tea ice cream \nI wish the ice cream had a stronger flavor of matcha but overall it was decent but kind of hard to eat because it was so thick \nMy friend got a double chocolate chip cookie with some sort of coffee ice cream but he would prefer them separately from each other and not in a sandwich \n\nWe also tried each other\u2019s and when I bit into his I didn\u2019t bite into the cookie much and just tasted the ice cream but wasn\u2019t a fan \nHe also said there could\u2019ve been a stronger taste of the matcha with mine",

I guess consistently serving slop off campus wasn\u2019t enough, and they had to replace rice & bones to further their woke agenda.\n\nRice & bones had solid (albeit expensive) food, local design has a poorly designed logo made on microsoft powerpoint online in what would take any design major less than 10 minutes. Wurster is a brutalist landmark, and rice & bones perfectly matched CED\u2019s cool aesthetic. Although the layout is fairly similar to r&b\u2019s, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get over the bright green of several lime Bubblys in the new self-serve cooler.\n\nA friend and I had the pleasure of enjoying the penultimate and ultimate Vietnamese coffees ever served at r&b at the end of that semester back in may of 2023. We spoke to the manager and he seemed pretty indignant about r&b being kicked out of Wurster, saying that they received note that their lease will be terminated in less than a month. Although the food and feels of r&b were unmatched, I think I\u2019ll miss the service the most. I'm sure the service of local design will be just as good as GBC, I\u2019m sure we can expect the same yells and screams that are indelible to GBC. Hopefully the line of freshman with pockets full of both flex dollars and cal themed lanyards waiting to be \u2018proudly\u2019 served a Boichik bagel, doesn\u2019t obstruct me on the way to class.\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m far too deep in nostalgia, but I\u2019ll, and I\u2019m sure many others will truly miss rice & bones, local design  and UC Dining spit in the face of me and many others.\n\n***A note from my friend who enjoyed the penultimate Vietnamese coffee:***\n\nWhat frustrates me the most is the university\u2019s disregard for vital elements of campus culture that make being a student here so special. Where does it end? These gems are being stripped from us solely in the name of profit. Stand for nothing, fall for anything.",

Go to career fairs, coffee chats, informations  Handshake events are great \n\n- Office Hours: I barely went to any and I regret it. Professors and GSIs are hella cool and will appreciate it. Especially go if not a lot of students go \n\n- Any concerts, recitals, performances from clubs, events, or from the music department\n\n- Berkeley nature: the glade, fire trails, big C, botanical garden, lawrence hall of science, cherry blossoms\n\n- Free AC Clipper: sign up for Baypass\n\n- Meal plan: the food isn\u2019t great but a \u201cfree\u201d meal is better than a paid meal\n\n- Snackpass\n\n- The ability to control your schedule. Take advantage of this\u2014 give yourself four day work weeks or all afternoon classes to sleep in \n\n- Decals/PE classes \n\n- Mezzo sandwiches, La burrita California burrito, Cheese n Stuff, El Talpense (Celia\u2019s), Gypsy\u2019s are my personal favorites that I\u2019m missing \n\n- If needed, Berkeley Food Pantry/Basic Needs Center \n\n- Free and For Sale \n\n- Astronomy Building with access to a telescope if you have astro friends\n\n- A club for any interest that you might have \n\n- The fact that going to Berkeley will prepare you better than 99% of schools for any post grad role \n\n- ASUC Student Legal Clinic\n\n- Not being confined to a 9-5\n\n& the fact that you attend one of the best schools in the nation in the SF Bay Area with a beautiful campus surrounded by smart intelligent people.

I have no idea how I'm going to beg professors to hopefully take late work so I don't fail. I wanted peoples advice on how to navigate these sort of situations.\n\nFor a bit more context, I felt awful during April and late march. I felt like everyone was doing better than me, and it seemed like everyone I knew was getting internships/research. I've always been a bit of a procrastinator but getting a subpar gpa made me feel like I should toss my ambitions of a prestigious grad school aside and I clearly am not cut out for Berkeley. I think an unhealthy combination of linkedin and social media made me feel like I was missing out on whats supposed to be the best time of my life, and I was simply fated to be this way. I'd wake up at 11:00 and scroll till 1:00 just because I didn't want to consciously have to deal with another day of losing. I'm not suicidal, but I hated thinking of dealing with life and what's its throwing at me. I know this sounds like your average Berkeley post and I too couldn't understand why I was feeling so bad about imposter syndrome(which everyone gets), but I couldn't out logic my emotions and mental state for whatever reason. This is why I think I felt bad, but I'm not entirely sure. A few other things happened but this was the main one.\n\nMaybe the answer is just welcome to the real world and I just got to suck it up and roll with the punches, but I wanted to know how people dealt with something like this. For context I wasn't a valedictorian and I know what its like to not be perfect, but this semester felt like I was constantly crashing down with occasionally a few hours every few weeks something good would happen.",

      "content": "**Intro.**\n\nI wanted to share my experience job searching and then finally getting a job. I worked at my first full-time software engineering job for 3 years and then got laid off in late 2024. I thought it would be fairly easy to find my next job since I had 3 years of experience and even a master's degree. But it was much more difficult than I expected.\n\n**Story time.**\n\nAt first I only applied to big tech. I even got to a final round big tech interview but the system design round went poorly and I did not receive an offer. After that I gradually ramped up the number of applications and widened my search. I'm mid-level but I was applying to junior as well as senior roles that fit my background.\n\nOver the first three months (Q1 2025) I got very few positive responses. In March I started applying more consistently, about 8 applications per day, and in mid April I ramped it up to about 25 per day. In May and June I started to get many more recruiter calls and interviews. At this point, every week I would have about four of them.\n\nAfter five months in I got close to the end with two different companies. But both ended up turning me down. Then finally, on a Tuesday I got an offer but it was with an early stage startup that couldn't offer much compensation. Like it wasn't just low for a software engineer, it was low for anybody. I happened to be interviewing with another company that same week, so I told them about my pending offer. They quickly scheduled my remaining interviews, which happened to all go well, and by Friday I received a much better offer from them. I took it.\n\nI feel incredibly fortunate because after seven months of searching I would have reluctantly taken a far worse offer, but the offer I got was very good.\n\n**Where I applied.**\n\nAbout 50% of my applications were on LinkedIn. The rest were company websites, Indeed, Built In, ZipRecruiter, and Handshake. Handshake is where I found my next job.\n\n**The numbers.**\n\nNow for the numbers... oh boy. In total I applied to 1892 jobs. I had 15 recruiter calls and 24 technical interviews, and approximately 12 online or take-home assessments. I made some charts:\u00a0[applications](https://ibb.co/Q43YDS5),\u00a0[interviews](https://ibb.co/pj79D3rY),\u00a0[sankey\\_diagram](https://ibb.co/Z61yDj5m).\n\n**Advice.**\n\nOver the months, I improved my resume but I wish I had done that sooner. I didn't used to have a \"Skills\" section but I added one and I think this helped. Recruiters are often just looking for key words.\n\nDon't give up. It was agonizing to search for seven months. And I know many of you have been searching for much longer. Something will come around. It's not you, it's the job market. You can get a thousand rejections but one offer, and that one offer is all that matters.\n\nI spent my free time working on a couple side projects and improving some skills, which I'm glad I did. I also spent more time with my friends and got more involved with my community through volunteering, which I'm also glad I did. Best of luck out there, and be happy that I'm no longer competing with you!",

They have taught me so much, and I genuinely like working with them.\n\n  \nHowever, I've found that my passion for programming has started to fade away. My day job is very far away from embedded systems, which as I mentioned before, is what I am passionate about. But when I get home, and even on the weekends, I just don't have it in me anymore to bust out the Arduino or STM32 board and do a side project. I used to love doing that stuff. It was my hobby, and I was good at it. \n\n  \nThat being said, I realize that it is in part what got me my current job. But, I can't help but be a little sad that I no longer have the energy, or passion, to start side projects like I used to. It is especially frustrating because I finally have the skills to do truly *cool* projects, but I just don't feel like it anymore.\n\n  \n**Conclusion**\n\nAgain, this is just to get other software engineers' perspective. Have any of you experienced anything similar? How do you get around this? I really *want*  to keep doing side projects, but just don't have the motivation anymore now that I write code 40+ hours a week.\n\n  \n**TLDR**\n\nGot a full time programming job. Don't have motivation to do side projects anymore. Makes me sad. What do other SWE's do about this?\n\n  \n",

I did screw myself because this new role wasn't paying that much more than my previous role and the commute was significantly worse, but I was already sort of burned out by my old place so I thought anything would be a nice change of pace.\n\nFast forward one and half weeks in. A few things struck to me as red flags -\n\n* Lack of process (No testing, extremely badly defined scopes and tickets, a non-existent onboarding experience, rubber-stamping PR's and sending it almost straight to production.)\n\n* Every employee aside from the founders/management had been working here for around a year or less despite the company having been around for the past 7 years or so.\n\n* Talks about overtime as if it was something to be expected.\n\n* Their estimations were in my opinion, kind of whack. A lot of the work that would've obviously taken far more effort were given 2 points (in their own parlance, should take up a quarter of a day). For example, I was given a task that was a 2 point (So expected to be completed within a quarter of a day.) that involved rewriting a few components from scratch and new endpoints and it wasn't until halfway that I started working on this ticket that I was informed by my manager that it was actually linked to another set of UI changes (Involving overhauling a page and several other elements) that were completely outside the scope of the ticket. This was considered an additional 4 points (One day in their parlance) and I was expected to complete all of those within a quarter of a day.\n\nThere might've been some disorganization but I was ready to understand, but what broke the straw on the camel's back was this following interaction that I had.\n\nAfter spending three hours glued to my screen working, I took a minute or two break just to check on my phone. It was lunch time and there were already co-workers actively having lunch and discussing about their lunch. I typically don't take a lunch break, so I tend to prefer to use this time just to check up on things on my phone.\n\nI was given a warning for using my phone for \"non-productive reasons\" and that I needed to give all of my attention and focus onto productivity during work hours. This was followed by another warning from another member of management. Essentially two people. (With heavy irony that the person giving me the warning was also on his phone in between waiting for things to load.)\n\nFollowed by a e-mail where the entire team was CC'ed, singling me out that I did not fall into their expectations for focus and productivity with possible escalation to the CEO.\n\nConsider this a vent or a plead for affirmation, but was it just me or did this behaviour come across as total overreach?\n\n Either way, I've decided that my way of working is clearly not aligned with the company's expectations and I immediately resigned on the spot. \n\nYes, I know that the market is bad and this may have been an overreaction on my part, but would anyone of you have done the same?",

Some tiny fixes, stuff that's typical for THIS project, rummaging around in the database to fix some documents' flow for the users etc. It's not that I sit around doing nothing, there is work to do, but I feel more like a corporate excel sheet master than a SWE.\n\nThere's little actual coding. The processes and flow are poor, the PM is rather bad, code reviews, well, at least sometimes they exist. In general, I make money, the job is steady, I save and invest, live with my mom, so getting laid off wouldn't be the end of the world. I'm just not learning much, or at least not the things that are considered good practice.   \nI want to get good at SWE tho and challenge myself. In order not to fall behind I study on my own, but sometimes I'm just too tired, the university demands other things, or I just wanna do other things - I'm in my early twenties lol.\n\nIn 2 years I'll have done what might amount to 6 months of work that my colleagues in well-managed companies/projects have done.

Maybe I'm overthinking it, but YOE that aren't proportional to my actual knowledge make me kinda anxious.\n\nOr maybe the baseline is that my YOE would be a way to get my foot in the door, and the rest is just a matter of getting prepared and passing an interview, and the rest is just fake it till you make it, until  things start to click - just like it was for the first time:)  \n  \nWhat's your view/advice?

Culture is amazing and coworkers are the best I've ever worked with. To keep a long story short, I've recently been onboarding a new client, and as such I've realized I'm both really good at and really enjoy running meetings, communicating with customers, etc. (but only as it relates to tech stuff).\n\n  \nAfter doing well in the onboarding process, I was nudged/recommended by the director of Customer Success Management to pursue a role within the company as a Customer Success Manager. Here's the comp for that role:\n\n* Base: $100 K\n* Variable: $20 K (typically would get $18k in reality)\n* Equity: \\~$80 K in stock options\n* Benefits & remote work: Same as current role\n\n  \nI like the idea of being a CSM (especially the higher pay), but I'm worried that the pay for CSMs levels off long before the pay for SWEs. At my company, Senior Lead CSM makes $230k.  Maybe a few years down the line if I hit a pay ceiling for CSMs I could transfer to sales and continue to increase my comp over time? Account Executives (sales) at my company have a starting pay of around $250k total comp.\n\n  \nOne last bit of context, I'm starting my masters degree in CS in the fall at Ga Tech (OMSCS). So maybe if I didn't end up liking CSM I would have clear path back into SWE once I graduate with that?\n\n  \nIt would definitely be a career change, at least for the time being. Especially considering I would no longer be writing any code. My main concern would be time missed/wasted not leveling up dev skills if I do decide to get back into SWE. I'm sure I'll be just fine in life whichever route I go down, but I would appreciate any thoughts or advice from any experienced engineers that have knowledge in this CS adjacent fields.

Should I exaggerate my past successes?\n* I don't like to throw around buzzwords. \nTo me they hide too much meaning and If you truly understand something you can say it in a way everybody understands. But I have had experiences working with PMs who used buzzwords constantly and half the time what they said made no sense to us developers. But I get the feeling that they passed the interview and got the job at my company because they used them. How do recruiters tell if a PM \u201cknows his stuff\u201d? Should I use buzzwords to sound competent in an interview? \n* I have taken a bit of a detour in my life and focused on art/writing for 2 years. This is a gap between my first developer jobs and my last developer jobs\nTo me this seems like a no go to recruiters. (please tell me if I'm wrong). Companies would rather hire somebody with the perfect CV than a person who seems \u201creal\u201d. Should I cut that part out of my CV or own it? \n\nI hope this kind of question is acceptable in this sub. If not, please excuse me. \n\nThanks a lot. \n",

Everything I learned for that job came from a Full Stack Udemy course.\n\nWhile I did go to a good university, my major was in Statistics, meaning that I don't have a computer science background and have been self taught. Other than the Udemy course, I took MIT's OCW class in data structures & algorithms ages ago which has helped when it comes to leetcode and the like. I also have a pretty decent understanding of high level system design from watching a ton of videos in preparation for interviews. This gave me enough knowledge to pass the interview.\n\nWe have a few backend developers on the team and they talk about things like concurrency, race conditions, etc, and are all very smart coming from working at Google and a Quant firm. I get the gist of what they're saying, especially after googling the terms and realizing that I knew the concept but not the word, but at the same time, I sometimes feel like I know absolutely nothing and it's starting to worry me (tbf it's only been 2 weeks but still).\n\nWhat sort of courses should I take so I can also slowly start understanding what's happening and not feel out of place? I do prefer video lectures rather than a book. It can also be paid. Additionally, is there any advice you guys can give me to succeed in this role and successfully keep it?

Officially, I was brought on as a Full Stack engineer. Everyone on my team is incredibly nice but the people on my team are primarily backend developers tackling those interesting problems. The people on my team and the other people around me come from some incredible companies. Most come from Google, Meta, Amazon, Netflix, Snowflake, etc, and have all gone to some pretty incredible universities.\n\nThen there's me. I've been working for the last 4 years at a very small no name company making very simple CRUD apps. I also went to a good school but I majored in Math/Stats so I don't have much knowledge of computer science past what is offered in first and second year of uni (and have also lost all my math/stats knowledge as I've never had to utilize those skills in the last 4 years).\n\nI never really felt impostor syndrome in my last job because the work we were doing was pretty straight forward and our userbase was only like 200 customers. We weren't doing anything novel and it was extremely simple CRUD apps that we were making which ran on one EC2 instance. The people around me also came from self taught backgrounds like myself. This current company has millions of users and these guys are throwing around technical terms while tackling their backend problems at scale, while I'm just thinking that the knowledge I've gained in the last 4 years can all be learned from a simple full stack course on Udemy.\n\nI realize that I was brought on as a full stack engineer to probably build the frontend and connect it with the backend services that my team mates are making, but I feel so replaceable and useless, like an LLM can do my job.\n\nSo, what should I do? Any advice is appreciated!\n\n  \n**Edit:** First off, idk if this is even necessary since I was brought on as a full stack like I said, but if I was to take courses (free or paid) to level up my knowledge, which courses would you recommend? The only \"real\" CS course I took was a course at my school on DS&A, but past that I haven't really taken any traditional courses and is mostly self taught.",

      "title": "From big tech to verge of collapse. What should I do next?",
      "content": "I have done B.Tech in CS and graduated in 2022 and I landed a FAANG internship. I thought a full-time offer was practically a sure thing.But then, no full-time offer materialized because of team structuring. Still, I secured an SDE-1 role at a major tech company, earning a solid 14-18 LPA.\n\nWithin a year, I left the work as the work wasn't challenging me as there was literally zero work related to actual product development / core software engineering, the culture felt stagnant and I was hungry for more.\n\r\nAfter leaving that SDE-1 role without any full-time offer, I pivoted to a freelancing role while prepping for the interviews for full time role alongwith DSA, System Design etc.\n\nI interviewed with 50+ companies including Google, Amazon, Zomato etc last year for the initial 7-8 months period.The Google interview was four months of pure emotional journey. I aced the first two tech rounds with \"Strong Hire\" and  \u201cHire\u201d ratings, the third round got completely derailed with a \"No Hire\" for the technical part and rated \"Hire\" for Googlyness by the same interviewer. After this they ghosted me for two months without any 'team matching' calls. In my Amazon interview I sailed through their technical rounds but got rejected in the leadership evaluation. Out of five companies where I actually cleared all the interview rounds, four of them just straight-up ghosted me. The single offer I did receive was a massive 40% below my previous salary and demanded relocation. I declined it.\n\nAfter this period while freelancing I earned what I used to make from my previous salary within two months. Here, I took a break from job searching as it was draining me mentally. But after three months, reality hit when the freelancing projects dried up. I decided to upskill (enrolled in Harkirat's 100xdevs cohort) for full-stack development.  Six months later, I'm only about 70% through the course. The freelancing money, my savings is now exhausted with only 3 months runaway.\n\r\nI've spent the last year grinding, working on my weaknesses. I've gone from zero to four to five production-ready MERN stack applications. I've genuinely evolved from an AI trainer(freelance work) to a full-stack developer.\n\r\nAfter these interviews, I figured out that three main issues consistently held me back:\r\n1. Role Mismatch: Companies just couldn't reconcile my AI training background with traditional SDE roles.\r\n2. Short Tenure: Leaving my first job within a year constantly came up.\r\n3. Weak Dev Skills (Back Then): Honestly, I just couldn't demonstrate core software engineering capabilities during technical rounds. API building, database schemas, system design.\n\r\nNow, I'm at a crossroads. I'm facing some big challenges:\n\r\n1. The CTC issue: My freelance income was hourly and in USD. When I mention my 25-30 LPA expectations, recruiters often ghost me. Should I anchor to my last full-time salary?\r\n2. Market Reality Check: With roughly 3 years of experience and this diverse background, is 25-30 LPA even realistic in today's market?\r\n3. Strategic Focus: Do I cast a wide net (remote, YC startups, EU, Dubai based) or grab the first decent Indian offer for stability?\r\n4. Ethical Job Title: During my freelance period, I applied my new full-stack skills to personal projects. Can I legitimately frame this as \"Contract Software Engineer (Full-Stack)\" on my resume, or is that crossing a line?\r\n5. Unable to get calls: Despite applying actively, I\u2019m struggling to get interview calls and even when recruiters reach out those calls are not converted to interviews.\n\r\nTo anyone who's been here, or helped someone through similar crossroads: what would you do?\n\n\nTL;DR\n\n2022 grad with 3 YOE (6 months of internship +1 yr FTE + 1.5 yrs freelance).

Even for $40k a year jobs which Im not even getting responses for. \n\nI did premed in my ugrad(chem bio ochem etc. on top of CS) Im confident I can apply and be accepted. Carribean MD is the fallback. \n\nMany complain about how doctors go to school for so long and make so little, but I went to school for just as long(my masters thesis took a while) and I had a 3 year \"residency\" first job for $60k a year, I broke six figures post covid and at this point Im making $0. If I chose MD path Id be making $200k-$600k/year at this point for the rest of my life. ",

It's a tiny company, and the pay is nothing to write home about (I'm living with my dad since I can't afford rent in my city) I'm learning a lot though, and there's many opportunities to lead feature initiatives within the company which is nice for a first job. I can recognize there's no room for growth here beyond that though.\n\nMy issue is not really knowing how to keep progressing my career. I keep seeing TikTok/Reels of the thousandth ivy league student happy about their internship/return offer to Meta or Citadel or something. These posts saturate social media to the point where it seems like the only paths to wealth are: Get a big tech internship while in school and land a return offer, make a 7 figure startup, or be banished to irrelevancy.\n\nI'm interested in those of you that were (are) in my shoes; what would you recommend someone like me do to keep progressing their career and land a reputable job in some big tech company? Is it just a matter of experience and interview prep, or should I be doing more like getting a masters?

For context, I currently work at Intel as an LLVM Compiler Engineer (3yrs here, 7yrs total experience), working almost exclusively on the optimizing middle-end. Plenty of CPU experience, but not much GPU experience, which I was upfront about and they were totally fine with throughout the process.\n\nOver the course of 4 weeks or so, I went through a pretty grueling hiring process (1 manager screen, 1 technical screen, 4 technical interviews + 1 behavioral interview) that mostly seemed to go well. Hiring manager seemed impressed by my personal projects and professional experience, and the interviewers all seemed like smart and capable people. At this time, I'm also in a process with Qualcomm for a CPU LLVM Engineer position and they also seem very interested (though I'm a bit skeptical of them, tbh the team seemed very demoralized and overworked). At this point, Apple said they want to move forward and we're in the offer phase.\n\nI just had a conversation with the recruiter this morning just checking the team was something I was interested in and starting the conversation about salary expectations. I told him I like the team and I'm very interested in what Apple has to offer. However, when I told him I'm expecting something in the base pay range of $200k - $250k he seemed very shocked. He used the phrase \"strongly misaligned\" on salary expectations. I told him the truth: I'm currently making close to the middle of that range at Intel, plus stock and bonuses (about another $20-40k). I panicked a little when I heard that, so I backpedaled a bit and told him that compensation wasn't necessarily the most important factor and hopefully it wouldn't be an impediment to them making an offer. He said he'll need to talk to the senior hiring manager and get back to me.\n\nI have another call scheduled with him tomorrow to talk again, but I'm worried I screwed up. The online posting says the base pay range is between $175,800 and $312,200, so I don't think I highballed them or made a ridiculous offer. I understand experience may be a mitigating factor, but I'm still really worried. Intel has been doing really poorly since I started working here, and while I like the work overall and have a good relation with my manager, working with my team can be pretty exhausting, and the layoffs have taken a heavy toll. All in all, I'm ready to get out.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks if you've read this far.",

      "content": "I'll be graduating university in Canada next summer (I'm a Canadian citizen) and am thinking about which offer to take.\n\nI've done internships at both companies so am already familiar with my team + general work culture. Note all numbers below are in US dollars, not Canadian dollars.\n\n**Offer 1:**\n\n* Role: New Grad SWE @ Big Tech in USA\n* Compensation: 240K TC (180K base + 60K in RSUs)\n* Location: Bay Area, fully in-person\n* Pros:\n   * Getting a big company name on my resume is good for career growth\n   * I work on large-scale distributed systems, using Rust and Golang, which is really cool\n* Cons:\n   * Higher cost of living than Canada (food + rent)\n   * It's fully in-person in the Bay Area, so I'll be away from family and friends in Canada\n   * Below average work-life balance (it's common to work until 6pm)\n   * I have to be part of an on-call rotation, and it's fairly common to get multiple alerts everyday\n   * RSUs are at a high valuation, and will only increase in value if AI continues to rapidly get better\n   * RSUs are not liquid since it's a private company\n\n**Offer 2:**\n\n* Role: Tech Lead @ Tiny Startup in Canada\n* Compensation: 240K TC (240K base + no equity)\n* Location: Canada, fully remote\n* Pros:\n   * I can live at home in Canada, free rent and healthy food (if I move out to live on my own, cost of living is cheaper)\n   * Better work-life balance, since work is remote and on-call only happens during big feature releases a few times a year\n* Cons:\n   * Company is tiny, so only person above me is the CEO, so there's very little room for long-term growth / pay raises\n   * Company is not well-known, making it harder to switch to a higher paying job in the future\n   * I work on same (good, but kinda boring) TypeScript tech stack I've been working on for years, so less career growth\n\nI'm tempted to choose the easier, less risky option of the Canadian startup.\n\nThe compensation is what I expected to be making near the end of my career, not the beginning, so maybe I shouldn't worry about career growth as much? In Canada, 240K USD is a crazy amount, especially for a New Grad - it's about about how much Google & Apple pays for senior engineers.\n\n**Which offer should I choose?** I'd love to hear all of your opinions. Especially if you're a Canadian who has worked in the US before (and either stayed or come back to Canada after a few years).\n\n\\---\n\n**Edit:** Someone in the comments said that my usage of big tech was too broad. To clarify, the company I was referring to is one of the leading LLM model companies in the US. There's very few, so take your guess.\n\n**Edit 2:** I'm obviously just gonna put \"Software Engineer\" on my resume if I accept the Canadian company offer, not \"Tech Lead\". I'm 100% not claiming I'm anywhere near as experienced as a senior software engineer. This is just the title the company gives me, which is why I put it in the post.\n\n**Edit 3:** The startup is more stable than the US company because they've existed for a decade without firing/laying off a single person. I guess they're more of a small business than a startup since they've been around for awhile.",

They were basically conducting experiments with their curriculum and teaching methods, and us students paid the price. I know Tsinghua and Peking University are extremely competitive, but I'm wondering if my work experience might help offset the low GPA.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Do Chinese universities like Tsinghua and Peking University consider work experience as heavily as US schools?\n2. Is there any pathway for someone with my profile at either school, or should I not even bother applying?\n3. Are there specific masters programs at Tsinghua or Peking that might be more open to non-traditional candidates?\n4. Should I consider taking additional coursework to demonstrate recent academic ability?\n\nI'm also applying to other schools as backup options, but Tsinghua and Peking University are definitely dream schools given their reputation in tech and finance.\n\nAny insights from current students, alumni, or people familiar with Chinese grad school admissions would be super helpful!\n\n**TL;DR:** Low undergrad GPA but strong tech industry experience - realistic shot at Tsinghua/Peking University masters programs or should I focus elsewhere?",

      "content": "So, I'm a new grad torn between two offers. One is SRE at a company that is mid-sized, tech/AI oriented, enterprise, good recent funding, seems really stable, GlassDoor reviews seem positive, unlimited PTO (that reviews say was usually approved), has good benefits but would require relocating. Another is SWE at a smaller start-up ish, can't find any info online about their revenue and funding, almost no GlassDoor reviews, no unlimited PTO, 7 year old e-commerce company.\n\nSalary wise due to relocating they both kind of wind up being the same net for me.\n\nMy brother who's worked as a Product Manager at Microsoft for a few years (but never worked in SWE) is telling me that the smaller company SWE position w slightly worse benefits is much better because the industry is so competitive right now that if you only have experience as an SRE it'll be hard to pivot to other roles in the future, and that it's a much better setup for my future career than an SRE role. He also said that it's better to work at a e-commerce marketplace company because the skills will be more transferrable and a lot of FAANG type companies will like that, whereas the enterprise AI company experience wouldn't be as direct.\n\nAnother engineer I talked to said the job titles don't matter that much, I'll only be able to tell once I start the job and know exactly what I'm doing that I'll know how useful the learned skills are, best I can do is look at the job description.\n\nSo I'm torn on what to do. If the job titles were the same I'd go with the mid-sized company 100%. But since the smaller company where I'm not sure about the work culture has the better title *and* doesn't require me to relocate I'm really not sure. Any advice on what it seems like the better role is, if SWE is that much better as my brother says it is? Idk I feel like the SRE position is at a company with such a stronger future. \n\nIf it helps, the SWE role works with C#, they said I'll be doing some QA and automation with Selenium. The SRE role will be working with Playwright and Kubernetes. I have no idea which of those skills would be more useful in the industry and neither does my brother/other engineer friend lol.",

      "content": "#Hey guys, I\u2019m posting for a friend who doesn\u2019t have a Reddit account with enough karma! Thank you\n \nI\u2019m currently a software engineer at Microsoft with 5 years of industry experience(mobile developer for a major product). Over the past few years, I\u2019ve developed a deep passion for philosophy of mind, artificial intelligence, and the ethical and societal implications of emerging technologies. I believe my long-term goal is to work as an AI ethics researcher, ideally contributing to both academic understanding and practical guidance for organizations building impactful systems.\n  \nTo pursue this, I\u2019m considering enrolling in a Master\u2019s in Philosophy to gain formal training in foundational and conceptual frameworks(philosophy of mind and ethics focus), with the eventual goal of pursuing a PhD in Computer Science or a related interdisciplinary field that focuses on AI ethics.\n  \nThat said, I\u2019m wondering if a single Philosophy master\u2019s is the most efficient path\u2014or if it might be worthwhile to simultaneously pursue a second Master\u2019s in Machine Learning or Computer Science. I recognize this may extend the timeline, but I\u2019m genuinely passionate about building a strong, cross-disciplinary foundation and want to make sure I\u2019m well-prepared to contribute meaningfully in both technical and ethical domains.\n  \nMy key questions are: \n \n* Is a PhD necessary to break into impactful AI ethics research, or can a Master\u2019s degree (or two) be sufficient?\n* Would pursuing two Master\u2019s degrees in parallel (Philosophy + ML/CS) make sense, or would you recommend a more focused route?\n* Are there specific programs or schools you would recommend for someone with this interdisciplinary focus?\n* Finally, does this path tend to offer long-term job security and practical opportunities in industry at major labs?\n  \nThank you so much for your time and any advice you can share\u2014I deeply appreciate it.",

First job working as a \"software developer\" role at a small company.\n\n**Background:**\n\n* In US\n* Graduated with a bachelors in software development at a lesser known university in 2023\n* 1 \"internship\" my last year of university \\*\\*explained later\n* First job April of this year\n\nI am feeling stressed since I feel like I am failing to advance my career. Internship and software developer are in quotations above since I feel like my case is special, but not in a good way.\n\nFor my internship during my last year of uni, I obtained it through handshake which is job posting site catered more towards students. The problem is that it was not at a known company, it was more like a small side gig someone was doing which they hired an intern to help them do some work. The work was a low code/no code type of work. I was the sole developer and just asked questions to my manager (also the owner of the site). I felt like I was not really getting the traditional feeling of an internship, the sdlc, and work I could put on my resume. At the time of my college career I felt like I needed an internship before I graduated so I took anything I could get, also the internship paid me around \\~20 hours each week which helped me as a student. It is difficult to put this on my resume sometimes since trying to explain this in any interview seems useless.\n\nI am grateful to have a job, but regarding my first job as a \"software developer\" which I recently got, I feel like the situation is similar to my internship. I found this job actually on indeed which is for a small company non-tech related, currently getting paid 50k salary (\\~36k after taxes). Again like my internship, they created this new position and I am the only developer. The problem I am having is that since it's a small company, I sometimes do work that isn't really related to software development (lol I know), such as setting up printers, working on upgrading old technology like phones, taking care of our server and basically IT work. In my time I don't have to do these things, I work on an actual project that is a full-stack web app that calls api from magento to display some information about orders to some clients. This was probably the most fun of the job I've had so far which involved my skills. The thing is that this web app is not being used till a few months from now, which leaves me with a lot of time.\n\nI also have a lingering fear in the back of my head about the future of my position because I am not sure where it will go since I am not constantly needing to create something. Like my internship I feel like this job is not furthering my career as a software developer.\n\nI do have free time not working on anything and do some lc and work on my technical interview skills. I guess I just want to hear some feedback from someone on what I could do. I've considered going back to school for a masters or the military but I prefer to try to score another job even though I know it's hard right now.",

Secondly, it is also not a well known company so I'm not sure how that would affect my career growth as a whole. On the other hand, I don't have any other offers. I am getting interviews at F500 and T1 startups but nothing\u00a0has stuck so far, although I do feel like I am close to getting a good offer.

      "content": "So I'm from South LA and we're in an honest to god war-zone right now. I've seen people get detained mere blocks from me, neighbors and friends are going missing, and fear has genuinely gripped the entirety of LA. And the absolute silence of everyone ASUC until today, day SIX of the raids, absolutely sickens me. While there were a few sporadic posts beforehand, no one actually shared anything until day FOUR of the raids?? HELLO? And absolutely nothing on the illegal detainment and release of SEIU President David Huerta because oh yeah, that historic inter-community organizing happened before day 6 so I guess it doesn't count... \n\nAnyway I opened Instagram today and after the forcible arrest of Sen. Alex Padilla, everyoneee ASUC started actually posting. Let's ignore that half of them probably want to intern with him, why would they wait so long? I saw so many of them posting aesthetic dc and hilltern pics literal hours before so did they coordinate to all post on the same day? And if so, why go through all the effort to only post a copy-paste know your rights template we've all seen floating around since January??? Key word is ONLY because yes know-your-rights should also be shared but... really? We elected you and this is the absolute most you can come up with? Yes I know, everyone ASUC is at a DC or Sacramento internship (wonder how they got that role...) but Latine ASUC-elected officials specifically ran on immigration as their key platform. Every. Single. One. Of. Them. So why wait until day SIX to actually post ANYTHING, the barest freaking minimum!!! I have data-science friends posting and organizing more than anyone ASUC and they don't even like leaving their house! I literally work 8 hours a day and still MAKE time to stay informed, spread the word, and check in on my Paramount family because yes, it's also still horrible there.  \n\n  \nAnyway I didn't write this to completely trash on the ASUC because there's still organizing work to be done for the greater community of immigrants, Californians, and average Americans whose rights are being unconstitutionally infringed upon. And they come first, always. I write this with the slim hope that a single human being reads this and maybe we can stop only seeing copy-paste know your rights templates and the same 3 Berkeley-area/Norcal specific immigration resources. Because that's such a waste of a huge social network that could actually make a difference. Here are the ideas me and my full-time employed friends have come up with:\n\n\\- Repost/share in an IG slideshow GoFundmes for ICE Raid victims or even fellow Berkeley Bears who've lost a family member and need help with legal fees. (Trust me, they're out there)\n\n\\- Follow area-specific immigration nonprofits in areas OUTSIDE of Berkeley.... because Bears exist everywhere in California. I've seen 5 different non profits post different, detailed, pro-bono immigration centers/lawyer lists on Instagram alone. The only work you'd have to do is repost the slideshow page or, if you absolutely can't live without the credit, copy paste it into a canva template and hit share. \n\n\\- Ask your LA friends about community-specific ICE incidents and repost their stories. 2 US Citizen highschool seniors were taken last friday and no one outside of my neighborhood is posting about it!! And today a Latina valedictorian was giving her graduation speech in Spanish and she was physically ATTACKED by a Karen mom in the audience and the principal did nothing!! Again nothing in the news but that happened to a highschool 20 minutes from me!! REACH OUT TO YOUR LA AND PARAMOUNT PEOPLE. So many stories are being suppressed. \n\n\\- POST ABOUT NO KINGS DAY PROTESTS!! Helloooo they're happening everywhere in the country and I've seen so many individual posts about it, I'm sure you can find 3 about the SF, LA, and Oakland area ones. \n\n\\- Part 2 of No Kings Day, just post about related protests. My friend just went to a Oaxacan press conference in DTLA when she's not even Mexican. We need to reach across divides now more than ever. And that takes more than a few empty but actual action. (Social media is a good start) \n\n\\- Just write a 5-minute letter. I saw 2 ASUC people do this and it was sweet, at the very least show that you're educated and engaged. \n\n\\- Linktrees. Everyone has linktrees, I like that just keep it updated. Kris Jenner would say \"you're doing amazing sweetie!!!!!\" \n\n\\- There's more but I need to make dinner and this isn't my job. I just need Berkeley to set an example because UCLA is pitch quiet right now even though there are officers stationed in Westwood. \n\n  \nMaybe these ideas are against some obsecure ASUC rule that has no real impact on the world. I don't know. But that's what personal social media accounts are for and if someone was elected, they have to have more than a single follower. So yeah. And if you just ran for ASUC to get some DC internships just say so because I'm getting tired. My friends are tired. My community is hurting deep. And I need to know if I'll side eye you at the Yopo line or not. Again this is said with no malicious intent, I'm just frustrated and need the ASUC to be held accountable.

      "title": "Frat Rankings and guide Fall Rush 2025",
      "content": "Too all the incoming freshman here is a somewhat subjective frat ranking, I know this is going to get some hate considering this community is generally pretty anti-greek life but I just wanted to put this out there so people can make informed decisions regarding where they decide to rush.  I'll give a short description on a few ones below\n\n\\+ is Trending up, - is trending down\n\nT1:-Zete, SAE\n\nT2: KA, +Phi psi, +ato, -fiji\n\nT3: -Pike, -Dke, +PKS\n\nT4: -ZBT,  SNU\n\nT5: AEPI, -Phi tau, sig chi\n\nT6: Pilam Aqua delt, theti chi\n\nT6: Phi delt, acacia\n\nI know there are other ones out there but I don't know much about them.\n\n**I'll give some background regarding the ones I know about**\n\nDisclaimer (I'll note on some that hazing is especially bad however all the firsts in the first 5 tiers all haze regularly)\n\nZete: Not affiliated with the school, pretty horrendous hazing. Strong brotherhood, when they do throw its pretty good however the reason I am saying they are trending down is because they literally haven't thrown all semester.\n\nSAE: Pretty well connected frat and also probably the most fratty frat on campus. Also pretty bad hazing but not quite as bad as Zetes. Pretty good game days they can get their house pretty packed, pretty much undisputed top always consistently good.\n\nt2: This is where things are pretty disputed\n\nKA: Don't want to hate at all but and I have a lot of great friends in KA but they are typically seen as sorority like frat,  they act as the \"gay best friend figure to sororities\" Some redeeming factors are they have a pretty good nighttime party set up, when they throw its pretty great, their house is not good but it gets the job done for parties.\n\nPhi Psi: Typically seen as the more indie/crunchy house, has been defiantly trending up so far. They are known for their frost party which is pretty great however their other parties and game days are not that great. However they are most definitely going up in the rankings\n\nATO: Par with Phi psi, they have also been trending up substantially in the rankings especially in the 2 last semesters. They have a large brotherhood and large house, probably have the best roof in Berkeley, their nighttime parties could be better. More fratty then phi psi and KA probably but not super fratty\n\nFiji: This is a interesting one, beautiful house and used to be a top house a few years ago, the background on them is they got kicked off campus for having roofies in the house(this sparked a huge controversy obviously). However, the individuals involved with that are long gone and they have a pretty decent house now, however they do suffer the consequences and are quite broke. They have a fratty and small brotherhood, small pledge classes.\n\nT3:\n\nPike: Last semester pike was terrible bringing them down to tier 3. Decent brotherhood kinda on the smaller side, stereotyped to be big into hard drugs, little more mix of alt and fratty. Their house is really small and ever since they lost their parking lot they fell a lot, no great place to throw parties.\n\nDke: A girl fell off their roof a few years ago and have been drowning in debt. I have never seen them throw, they have a really small brotherhood now even though it used to be a top house back in the day. the guys left in it are chill though.\n\nPKS: Rising, they throw decent consistent parties mostly for lower tier sororities and none greek people. However they have good turn out and a pretty nice house. Brotherhood is much more alt vibe, so if that for you go for it.\n\nZBT: Was on the rise and then stopped doing almost everything last semester, don't really know much else about them. House is pretty small\n\nSNU: really don't know much about them, nice house, hazing is notably hard for a lower middle tier frat\n\nPhi tau: A girl fell off their roof this cal day not sure if they will still be having rush in fall.\n\nAll the other tiers I don't really know much about, this tier stuff doesn't really mean anything and what really matters is which house you connect with the best!",

      "title": "After your last final at Berkeley",
      "content": "Yeah\u2026 everything after your last final at Berkeley just dissolves into this surreal, slow-motion blur. You sit there, finishing the last few questions, maybe in Wheeler, Dwinelle, or one of those cold, echoey rooms in Evans. You double-check your answers one last time, not because you need to, but because you don\u2019t want it to end just yet. Then you hand it in. That is your last exam at Berkeley. The last test you will ever take as a student here.\n\nYou step outside into the beautiful Berkeley sun, or maybe it\u2019s already night after a 7 to 10 p.m. final, and you stand there for a moment, not sure what to do. That is when it hits you. You are done. Not just with that exam, but with all of it. Every lecture you half-slept through. Every lab you dreaded. Every panicked night in Main Stacks. Every time you told yourself, just get through this week. It\u2019s all over.\n\nAnd there is no celebration. No moment that feels big enough. No one waiting for you. You just walk out, alone.\n\nYou wander around campus a bit, not because you need to, but because you cannot go home yet. Everything looks the same, but it no longer feels like yours. You pass by the Campanile. Maybe it\u2019s ringing. You used to find comfort in that sound. Now it just reminds you that time is still moving, even when you feel frozen. You are not headed to class. You are not meeting friends. You are not running late to a section you forgot about. You are just someone walking through a place that is starting to forget you.\n\nSproul is still full of life, but you are not one of them anymore. You move through the crowd like a ghost. You are invisible in the place that once made you feel seen. You pass buildings that hold too many memories in your freshman year. Dwinelle, with its endless hallways and its always-broken elevators. The way you used to get lost even in your junior year. The way it smelled like stress and old chalk and the way it held a hundred of your quiet, forgettable days. Wheeler, you can still picture where you used to sit. Which rows you claimed. Who sat beside you.\n\nMoffitt, more than just a library. It was a second home. You studied there. You cried there. You napped in chairs that were too uncomfortable and somehow still comforting. You watched the sun rise once, maybe twice, after staying all night for a final or midterm you thought would break you. You shared looks with your secret library crush across long tables... The ones that never turned into anything. The stranger you kept seeing on the fourth floor, always headphones in, lost in their own world. The two of you shared the same space, the same time, the same struggle, and maybe something else too. You never spoke. You always thought maybe next time. And then time ran out. They\u2019re gone now. Or maybe they\u2019re still here. Either way, that version of the story never got written. It lingers in your mind like a question you\u2019ll never answer. A softness that never became anything more.\n\nNow, those places feel like closed doors. Like the campus is gently but firmly telling you it is time to go. Not in anger, not in rejection, but because it has to keep going. And you are no longer part of that motion. And you know that the next time you come back, if you ever do, it will not be the same. The buildings you knew will change. Some will be torn down. Others will rise in their place, sleek and unfamiliar. Your old classrooms may be demolished, your favorite corners renovated. The people will be different. The energy will be younger. The world will move on without you, and Berkeley will too.\n\nThe glade will still be green. The sun will still set over the Bay with that soft orange glow. But you will not be running to class or waving to a friend or finding a spot on the lawn with your lunch. You will just be visiting. A stranger to the new students. A memory to the old ones. And no one will know what this place meant to you. No one will know where you used to sit or cry or laugh. No one will remember your version of Berkeley, because that version lived and ended with you.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nThen commencement week arrives. And it is supposed to be joyful. Everyone is in caps and gowns, families cheering, people crying and hugging in the stadium, trying to capture something that is already slipping away. You smile for the pictures. You laugh with friends. You go along with it, because that is what you are supposed to do. But inside, it feels like you are watching it all from far away. Like the moment is happening to someone else.\n\nYou try to feel proud. You try to feel excited. But mostly, you feel... nothing. Or too much, all at once. A strange mix of relief and emptiness, like you finally reached the end of a very long, very hard road, only to find yourself standing still. You thought it would feel different. You thought you would cry. Or feel something big. Instead, it all just feels quiet. Like you are floating through it. Like you are already starting to disappear.\n\nAt your department\u2019s ceremony at Greek Theatre, you sit surrounded by your classmates, people you shared lectures with, passed in hallways, maybe even shared late nights in the library with... and you realize this might be the first time you are hearing some of their names. You look around and see so many familiar faces, people you saw again and again over the years but never really knew. You shared time with them. four years of your life. And now they are walking across the stage, one by one, and you know this might be the last time you ever see them. You clap for them. You smile when your name is called. You walk the stage. You do everything right. But even as you do, there is a voice in the back of your mind asking quietly, is this really it? Four years. Hundreds of lectures. Thousands of hours. All those late nights. All that effort. And now you are just... done.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nAnd then you think of your friends. The ones you saw almost every day. The ones you studied with until 2 a.m. in Main Stacks or camped out with in the depressing reading rooms before finals. The ones you grabbed late-night boba with, sat with on the glade doing absolutely nothing. You might still have the same chat group. You might promise to visit, to FaceTime, to stay in touch. But deep down you know how life works. Everyone will leave. Everyone will start jobs, move to new cities, fly to new countries. People change. People drift. It might be years before you see some of them again. And for others, this might really be the last time. That thought sinks in quietly. But it stays. And it hurts.\n\nIt\u2019s time to pack. You roll up old posters. Fold clothes you wore to classes you forgot you ever took. You throw out lecture notes or cheat sheets you once thought you would keep forever. You look out your window one last time. The streets below are still alive, but you are already somewhere else in your mind. You take a walk down Telegraph or through Southside, past Raleigh\u2019s, past those little shops you never got around to visiting. Past the restaurants you always meant to try. And you realize that this version of Berkeley, the one you knew, only exists in your memory now.\n\nWhen you finally leave, it feels unreal. You think back to the first day you moved in. GBO Week, when everything felt too loud and too new. Your first lecture in a massive hall where you felt like no one would ever know your name. The first time you felt like you belonged. Your first fail midterm. Your first win. It all plays in your head like scenes from someone else\u2019s life. You do not know how to feel. Everything comes at once. You feel proud and empty. Grateful and afraid. Full of love for this place, and somehow hollow at the same time.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nAnd the hardest part?\n\nThere is no more routine. No more rushing out the door for your 8 a.m. in Wheeler, half-awake . No more sitting through back-to-back lectures in VLSB or Cory, trying to stay focused while your mind drifts. No more Canvas notifications reminding you of deadlines you already missed. No more waiting for office hours in crowded hallways, hoping a GSI can save your grade with one more regrade request. There is no more Gradescope eating your homework submission or telling you the deadline passed thirty seconds ago.\n\nNo more bCourses tabs left open for weeks, filled with lecture slides you promised you\u2019d review one day. And now, all of it... all those tabs, all those bookmarks... you quietly close them one by one. Just like that. The last traces of your academic life erased from your screen. There are no more meal swipes. No more grabbing boba with friends and running into someone you know.\n\nNo more waiting in line at Yali\u2019s or Raleigh\u2019s or peeking into MLK hoping to find an open table. No more sitting on the steps near Campanile as the sun sets behind golden gate bridge, watching the sky turn soft and golden, pretending the moment could last forever. No more borrowing mac chargers or frantically looking for outlets. No more pulling each other through finals with late-night La Burrita and quiet reassurances of \u201c*we\u2019ll be okay..*.\u201d\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\n**It hurts...** It is okay to feel numb. It is okay to feel lost. You are grieving something real, even if no one calls it that. This is not just the end of school. It is the end of a life you built from scratch. A version of you that only existed here, in this exact place, surrounded by the people and the moments that shaped you.\n\n**And if it still hurts**, it just means it mattered. It means you loved something deeply. It means Berkeley was never just a campus. It was a home. A place that held your laughter, your stress, your growth, your failures, your joy. A place that will never fully understand what it meant to you, but one that quietly witnessed your becoming.\n\n**So let it hurt.** Let yourself miss it. Take a slow walk through campus if you still can. Look at the Campanile one last time. Breathe in the late spring air. Say goodbye in whatever way feels right. And when it is time to leave, know that your version of Berkeley will live with you forever.\n\nYou are not alone in this sadness. Not now. Not ever.\n\nGo Bears. Always. >!(Fuck Stanford)!<\n\nClass of 2025! Thanks for taking the time to read all of this :'( it really means a lot. I know it\u2019s kind of a mess, just me trying to put scattered thoughts and feelings into words. I hope even a part of this resonated with you. Maybe save it and revisit it in a few weeks, or a few months. When things settle a bit, when the noise in your head quiets down, this might hit in a different way.",

So as I reiterated last time, greek life in general at Cal is pretty dead compared to other colleges but it\u2019s really the only place where you can have both the work hard mentality and party hard, especially if you\u2019re in greek life and into the \u201csorority and fraternity\u201d experience. **Just a warning**, these are all just my personal opinions and what I think the general idea is of greek life fraternities at berkeley.

There are some good brothers and also the bad in every house but see what fits your vibe and go for it! I know that this sub hates greek life but I just wanted to put this out there for anyone who might be interested.

This feels like a long shot, but I recently found out that my taxidermed bear (his name is Bernie) was taken from the now defunct Chi Psi. \n\nTo give some background, I was given this bear by my aunt around 2012 and have kept it at the fraternity because it felt like they had a much better reason (and space) to have a large, stuffed bear. When they were shut down this fall, I was told that Bernie was placed in a locked room and there was a plan to move it to a storage space until they could be brought back onto campus. I was planning on taking some time off this winter to fly down and pick him up, but I found out that he is no longer there. \n\nI understand the motivation behind wanting to kidnap Bernie. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t want a full sized bear at Cal?! For that reason, I\u2019m not particularly angry, just kinda sad because I want to know that he is ok. \n\nMy ask, if you have any information on the whereabouts of Bernie, or if you happen to be one of the individuals in possession of Bernie, could you please shoot me a DM and let me know that he\u2019s ok. I\u2019m not looking to pursue any sort of legal action or get anyone in trouble, I just want to know that he\u2019s in good hands, where he\u2019s at, and hopefully have the opportunity to come pick him up.

I was admitted for bioengineering for both schools but I want to take a pre med path. I live in so cal and only about an hour away from LA so I feel like it\u2019s in an area I know and am familiar with. BUT I also really liked Berkeley when I went and visited (especially the public transit and it was sunny for the duration of my visit\u2014but idk if this is rare). My problem is I don\u2019t know whether to choose LA for the medical opportunities or Berkeley for the better engineering program. I want to go into medicine so keeping a high GPA is a priority. \n\nAnother big difference is the quarter vs semester system. Some people say quarters feel rushed but they allow for more exploration/taking more fun random classes. However, people say semester is boring since you\u2019re stuck with the same course for 15 weeks. A benefit of semester is the dead week, but is that worth it? \n\n Also, the quality of life at UCLA seems really good. I love food and their dining halls are supposed to be the best in the nation and good food can be found throughout LA. Whereas Berkeley has mediocre dining halls but good food outside the campus and in SF. \n\nSince I want to go into medicine, I\u2019m worried that there aren\u2019t that many medical focused opportunities in Berkeley and that there isn\u2019t much pre med support there. While there is UCSF, the trip would take an hour each way IF I get an opportunity. I\u2019m also worried that there is a ton of competition at LA since there are about double the pre med students at UCLA than in Berkeley. Berkeley might get me closer to internship opportunities but I think that would mean I would have to stay in the Bay Area over the summer, which could be costly. And speaking of cost both schools gave no aid so it\u2019s pretty much the same cost.\n\nFinally, I have some close friends going to LA and that could be a positive, but I don\u2019t want to base my decision on friends since I feel like college is a good time to explore. On the other hand it may be better to have some pre established connections.  \n\nPlease tell me if any of these thoughts are stupid or misguided. Thanks!!!!\n",

      "title": "Let's Discuss Upcoming UCPD Encryption",
      "content": "For those who don\u2019t know me, I ran the ScanBerkeley account (@scanberkeley) while I was a student here (graduated in December 2023). *Not to be confused with The Berkeley Scanner (we\u2019re totally separate)*. ScanBerkeley was dedicated to monitoring and sharing urgent public safety info from UCPD, Berkeley PD, and Berkeley FD radio traffic. I wanted to post here about something that\u2019s about to impact public safety and transparency for everyone at UC Berkeley.\n\n  \nUCPD is now planning to encrypt their main dispatch radio channels along with most agencies around the East Bay. They \"claim\" this is required by a DOJ mandate regarding personal information. That is false. Units can run information via their vehicle computers (MDTs) and be in full compliance. They can use a second channel (which BPD already does). They can even \"break\" apart transmissions so information is not sent together, and still be in full compliance.\n\nHere is a section of the requirement to be in compliance: \n\n>\u201cEstablish policy to restrict dissemination of specific information that would provide for the protection of restricted CJI database information and combinations of name and other data elements that meet the definition of PII. This will provide for the protection of CJI and PII while allowing for radio traffic with the information necessary to provide public safety.\u201d\n\n\u00a0*(Source: California DOJ Information Bulletin, Confidentiality of CLETS Information, p. 2; FBI CJIS Security Policy Sections 5.10.1.2 & 5.13.1.1)*\n\n  \nWhy does this matter?\n\n* UCPD\u2019s real-time notification system has major issues. For years, WarnMe alerts have been vague, delayed, or missing critical context. If you\u2019ve ever received a generic \u201cpolice activity in the area\u201d message, you know how unhelpful that can be in a real emergency.\n* There have been many incidents where UCPD\u2019s official alerts excluded key descriptions like the suspect race, locations, etc. In many of these cases, I was able to provide that information within seconds of a dispatch, while the campus community waited hours (or never received an update) from official sources.\n* Open dispatch channels allow nearby police, fire, and emergency services (EOCs) to stay aware of ongoing incidents and respond more effectively. Full encryption makes cross-agency coordination harder, slows down emergency responses, and ultimately undermines community safety. *(FUN FACT: Campus staff/response personnel even used my tweets during an active incident once because PD took so long to tell them. Will key staff get encrypted radio access? Doubt it.)*\n\n\n\nWhat about officer safety? What if criminals are listening?\n\nWhile this is a valid worry in certain tactical situations, most agencies already handle sensitive operations on separate encrypted tactical channels, keeping the main dispatch open for routine calls. In practice, general dispatch rarely includes the kind of information that would compromise officer safety, and any critical details can be quickly moved to a secure channel if needed. It\u2019s also important to understand that even with full voice encryption, the control channels used by digital radio systems remain unencrypted. These control channels still reveal which radio IDs are active, which talkgroups are being used, and when units are transmitting. With the right tools and some research, someone could still monitor patterns and activity.\n\n\n\nFinal argument, IT IS ALL PUBLIC RECORDS! Anyone can request the audio. All this changes is some intern will likely need to go redact small portions of the radio traffic. Only major issue with this, is UC Berkeley's public records takes months to return. (I am still waiting for some from 2 years ago).\n\n\n\nThanks to a city council resolution, **Berkeley PD is required to keep their primary dispatch open to the public.** ([https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2021-09-28%20Item%2018%20Lease%20Agreement%20with%20Motorola%20-%20Supp%20Harrison.pdf](https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2021-09-28%20Item%2018%20Lease%20Agreement%20with%20Motorola%20-%20Supp%20Harrison.pdf)) There are no current plans to encrypt the fire department radio traffic. UCPD is not subject to these restrictions. To be clear, TAC channels should be encrypted. Tactical incidents can always be moved to a secondary channel. I am only pushing for dispatch to remain open.\n\n\n\nIf you care about this, now is the time to speak up. Contact the Chancellor, ASUC, UCPD Accountability Board, and tell them you want UCPD to keep dispatch channels open like Berkeley PD will be doing. Anyway, happy to discuss more below. :)",

I received a letter saying that my health plan had been changed to one in Alameda County, which I didn't anticipate since I lived in San Francisco County and have no issue with accessing them during the school year. \n\nThen, I went to the Alameda Social Office to see what the issue was. They said that my MediCal case is still managed in San Francisco, and likely it's your address that's been changed, so your health plan got reassigned. Since I am the type of person who is afraid of asking for help so I tried to resolve this by myself. Obviously, it wasn't successful, so I finally decided to reach out for support. I filled out the BNC Assistance Form, and a coordinator reached out to reassure me that it is acceptable to have CalFresh benefits in one county while having MediCal benefits in your home county (Since you're living in Alameda temporarily for school). \n\nMy advice for everyone is **always** to look out for support; they have more knowledge dealing with this issue than you, and they will better assist your situation.

We ask for just a two-week commitment, and we'll send you home with everything you need to get started: an x-pen, litter box, bedding, food, hay, bowls, blankets, and more. All you provide is a safe, loving space, daily care, and fresh greens (about $5\u201310 per week).\n\nIt's amazing what a couple weeks in a calm, caring home can do for a shy or nervous rabbit. Your support helps them open up, gain confidence, and prepare for adoption. And by fostering, you also help us make room at our shelter for more rabbits who need to be rescued!\n\nHave questions? Stop by our facility and chat with House Rabbit Society volunteers and staff during our open hours on Fridays and Saturdays from 11 to 4, and Sundays from 11 to 3, or email\u00a0[foster@houserabbit.org](mailto:foster@houserabbit.org). We'd love to talk more with you!",

      "content": "  \n\ud83d\udc49Cal Alum Sign-Up Form (for those who can provide referrals):\u00a0[https://forms.gle/PNfy9DKzUbQR5RLo6](https://forms.gle/PNfy9DKzUbQR5RLo6)   \n\ud83d\udc49Cal Student/New Grad Early Interest Form:\u00a0[https://forms.gle/P1smd8FaH3DM97Zr6](https://forms.gle/P1smd8FaH3DM97Zr6)  \n  \n  \nWe all know the job market is kinda ass right now, especially for new grads. Been there, done that... it\u2019s rough. As someone who\u2019s been through that cycle of hell, I wanted to try building something to make it suck a little less for fellow Bears.\n\nSo I\u2019m building something for us: a **Berkeley-only Discord** that\u2019s more than just chat. It\u2019s a focused **pipeline** for resume help and job referrals... no coffee chat, no fluff, no corporate vibes, just Bears helping Bears.\n\n# The Goal\n\nBuild a no-BS space where:\n\n* Students get resume help from people who actually know what hiring managers/recruiters want (Roast Your Resume, Get brutally honest feedback about your resume)\n* Alumni refer students when they\u2019re ready\n* Everyone feels comfortable and chill asking for help and offering help\n\n# The Roadmap\n\n**Stage 1: Core Alumni Team**  \nRight now I\u2019m gathering a small group of grads who:\n\n* Are working (or recently hired) and down to help\n* Can review resumes and submit referrals right after\n* Have 1\u20132 hours a week max to give back\n\nNot looking for career coaches. Just regular folks who remember the struggle and want to help someone else through it.\n\n**Stage 2: Early Access for Students & New Grads**  \nOnce we have a decent core, I\u2019ll invite a small batch of Berkeley students/recent grads to test the system. You\u2019ll:\n\n* Submit your resume\n* Get it reviewed by someone who's been in your shoes\n* Get referred when your resume\u2019s in good shape\n\nThis is **not** a spammy job board. It\u2019s 1-on-1 discord help.\n\n**Stage 3: Structured Roles + Submission System**  \nWe\u2019ll build out some simple structure:\n\n* Resume Reviewers (alumni volunteers)\n* Referral Leads (people who actually submit referrals internally or submit directly to recruiters, not just a social job link)\n* Submission queue with deadlines (e.g., 72-hour review turnaround)\n\n**Why This Matters**\n\nThere are so many alumni who *would* help if someone just asked... but most students never do. They don\u2019t know how, or it feels awkward. This fixes that. It\u2019s all about making help **easy to ask for** and **easy to give**. No weird LinkedIn DM, no waiting three weeks for someone to \u201ccircle back.\u201d\n\nAnd let\u2019s be real \u2014 **f\\*ck cold LinkedIn DMs and coffee chats.**\n\nNo one wants to hop on a \u201cquick 15-minute coffee chat\u201d after a full day of work or meeting just to talk in circles and pretend we\u2019re networking. Both alumni and students are tired. This is for people who want to cut the fluff and actually help each other get jobs \u2014 fast.\n\nEveryone in the server will be [**berkeley.edu**](http://berkeley.edu) **verified**. No randos. Just a chill, focused space where Berkeley students and grads can connect, review resumes fast, drop referrals fast, and move on with their lives.\n\nAnd yeah, it\u2019s 100% free. The only rule? If you get a job (through this thing or not), you have to come back and help the next Bear. Review a resume. Drop a referral. Keep the cycle going. No excuses. No freeloaders. Just a low-key referral cult built on good karma and getting sh\\*t done.\n\nNot sure yet which industries we'll focus on... honestly just seeing who shows up first. Could start with tech, but if we get folks from consulting, finance, biotech, etc., we\u2019ll adapt. Totally depends on the mix of grads who want to help.\n\n# Interested?\n\n# Alum: If you\u2019re down to review a few resumes and keep refer someone now and then, drop a comment or DM me. Doesn\u2019t have to be a big time commitment.\n\nStudents/New Grads: If this sounds like something you\u2019d join once it\u2019s live, plese upvote this post... I\u2019ll slowly roll out invites once we\u2019re ready and have enough folks who can help.\n\nP.S. We're the same people who started the Free Food@Berkeley Discord in 2022, which turned out to be pretty successful... That was fun, now we\u2019re just looking to build something new that\u2019s actually useful. Hope you'll be part of it.

      "title": "While most schools chase prestige in single disciplines, UC Berkeley cracked the code on undergraduate ROI by being consistently second-best at everything",
      "content": "What up Cal,\n\nI wrote a post for The College Sherpa about how we might be grossly underrated school. \n\nI'll post the entire article below so you don't have to click off, but I wanted to share it here because I was really excited writing it.\n\nHere's why I think y'all will like this story:\n\n* It's about Cal. It should probably just end there.\n* Cal is probably the best choice for \"most\" people\n* Cal has carved itself a pretty good niche in the world of college admissions\n\nIf you wanna check it out, here's the original post: [https://collegesherpa.beehiiv.com/p/the-biggest-scam-in-higher-education](https://collegesherpa.beehiiv.com/p/the-biggest-scam-in-higher-education)\n\n# Why This School Should Probably Be A Top 3 School\n\n**While most schools chase prestige in single disciplines, UC Berkeley cracked the code on undergraduate ROI by being consistently second-best at everything**\n\nI'm sitting in a Palo Alto coffee shop next to two parents having the kind of conversation that makes you eavesdrop shamelessly.\n\n\"Harvard rejected Emma, but she got into Berkeley engineering,\" says one. \"I'm honestly relieved.\"\n\nThe other parent nearly chokes on her oat milk latte. \"Relieved? It's Berkeley.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but think about it. She'll probably switch majors twice, graduate debt-free, and still end up at Google. Meanwhile, Sarah\u2019s kid is studying classics at Harvard for $320,000.\"\n\nThat overheard conversation captures something fascinating happening in elite education. While parents obsess over getting their kids into schools that dominate specific rankings, UC Berkeley has quietly perfected a different game entirely.\n\n**The portfolio theory of college admissions**\n\nHere's Berkeley's not-so-secret weapon: they're not #1 at anything major, but they're consistently top 3 at everything.\n\nComputer science? #3 behind MIT and Stanford. Business? #3 behind Wharton and Stanford. Engineering? #3 behind MIT and Stanford. Psychology? #2 behind Harvard. The pattern holds across virtually every undergraduate program.\n\nThis sounds like a participation trophy strategy until you realize most 18-year-olds have no clue what they actually want to study. According to the Department of Education, 80% of students change their major at least once, and the average student changes majors three times.\n\nAt Harvard, switching from their #1-ranked economics program to their middle-tier engineering program feels like academic exile. At Berkeley, switching majors means moving from one top-3 program to another top-3 program.\n\n\"It's portfolio diversification applied to education,\" explains Dr. Sarah Chen, who studies higher education economics at Stanford (ironically). \"Berkeley accidentally created the index fund of universities.\"\n\n**The innovation breeding ground effect**\n\nBut Berkeley's real genius isn't in the rankings\u2014it's in the collision effect.\n\nWhen you're #1 at computer science, you attract the world's best computer science minds. When you're top 3 at everything, you attract the best minds from every field, and they all end up in the same dining halls, study groups, and weekend parties.\n\n\"I met my co-founder in a philosophy class, my lead engineer in an art history seminar, and my first investor at a poetry reading,\" says Maria Rodriguez, whose Berkeley-founded startup was acquired by Apple for $400M. \"That doesn't happen at specialized schools.\"\n\nThe numbers back this up. Berkeley undergraduate alumni have founded more companies valued at $1B+ than any other public university. They've also won more Nobel Prizes, started more nonprofits, and held more Fortune 500 CEO positions than graduates from schools with higher overall rankings.\n\n**The stealth wealth angle**\n\nThen there's the economics that make wealthy parents pause their Ivy League obsession.\n\nBerkeley's in-state tuition runs about $15,000 annually. Out-of-state hits $48,000\u2014still cheaper than most privates. But here's where it gets interesting: savvy families have discovered loopholes that would make tax attorneys proud.\n\nSome establish California residency through \"digital nomad\" programs. Others use Berkeley's satellite programs. A few leverage obscure scholarship programs tied to specific counties or professions.\n\n\"I know parents who've bought $200,000 condos in Oakland just to get their kids in-state tuition,\" says one educational consultant who requested anonymity. \"Do the math\u2014they save $120,000 over four years and end up with Bay Area real estate.\"\n\nMeanwhile, their kids get the same professors, research opportunities, and alumni networks as students paying full freight at comparable private schools.\n\n**The prestige paradox**\n\nThe final twist? Berkeley's \"second place\" strategy is creating a different kind of prestige.\n\nWhile Harvard graduates network within narrow alumni circles, Berkeley graduates populate every industry at every level. They're the CEOs hiring Harvard MBAs, the VCs funding Harvard entrepreneurs, and the professors teaching Harvard students.\n\n\"Berkeley doesn't produce the most exclusive graduates,\" notes education researcher Dr. James Wilson. \"They produce the most connected ones.\"\n\nThis shows up in unexpected ways. Berkeley alumni are more likely to hire from diverse schools, more likely to promote based on merit over pedigree, and more likely to challenge conventional wisdom\u2014probably because they've been doing it since freshman year.\n\nThat coffee shop conversation I overheard? The relieved parent was onto something. Sometimes being second-best at everything beats being first-best at anything.\n\nEspecially when \"everything\" includes the ability to think differently about what winning actually means.",

      "content": "I\u2019ll be starting a PhD at Berkeley soon, and I\u2019m choosing among three apartment options. I know that there are tradeoffs for all of these options, and ultimately only I can weigh them, but if people with experience as a PhD student and/or experience living off-campus in Berkeley can give their two cents, that could help a lot! To add some context, I\u2019m an avid cyclist so that\u2019s how I plan to get around. I value urban living (I know Berkeley is more  \u2018dense suburban\u2019 in much of the city) in that I like being decently close to at least a few cafes and restaurants. And a bar, ideally. It would be great to not have to share stuff with too many roommates \u2014 I currently live in a tight four-bed, and kitchen space has been a source of frustration (though not conflict) from time to time. I\u2019d also love to not have to share a bathroom with too many people. \n\nIt would also be helpful to know if these rents are reasonable for their locations. In the city I\u2019m coming from, I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at sniffing out when a place is overpriced. I\u2019m pretty okay with living a bit farther from campus to pay less\u2014again, I\u2019m an avid cyclist and I\u2019m pretty confident that I can get around easily that way. \n\n**Option 1:** I can pay $1145/month to live about 1.5 miles west of campus in a decently sized furnished room with a private bathroom and four roommates. But it\u2019s farther from cafes, restaurants and bars, as well as a mile from BART. I\u2019d also have to walk about a mile to get to any grocery store. \n\n**Option 2:** I can pay $1225/month to live about 1.8 miles from campus in a huge furnished room with two roommates, one bathroom, and no dishwasher. I\u2019d be 5 minutes from BART and walking distance to numerous bars, restaurants, and grocery stores. It\u2019s right by the Oakland border and close-ish to Temescal/Bushrod, so my guess is it isn\u2019t near tons of undergrads but idk. My pause is that I\u2019d be sharing the bathroom with two other people. \n\n**Option 3:** I can pay $1500/month to live about 2.3 miles in a studio in Temescal (Oakland). It would be unfurnished. It\u2019d be very close to a few grocery stores and about a 15 minute walk from BART. My pause is that this is significantly pricier than every other option, and the PhD stipend at Berkeley is very good as far as stipends go, but it\u2019s not high. I\u2019d be spending 38% of my pre-tax income on rent. ",

      "title": "After your last final at Berkeley",
      "content": "Yeah\u2026 everything after your last final at Berkeley just dissolves into this surreal, slow-motion blur. You sit there, finishing the last few questions, maybe in Wheeler, Dwinelle, or one of those cold, echoey rooms in Evans. You double-check your answers one last time, not because you need to, but because you don\u2019t want it to end just yet. Then you hand it in. That is your last exam at Berkeley. The last test you will ever take as a student here.\n\nYou step outside into the beautiful Berkeley sun, or maybe it\u2019s already night after a 7 to 10 p.m. final, and you stand there for a moment, not sure what to do. That is when it hits you. You are done. Not just with that exam, but with all of it. Every lecture you half-slept through. Every lab you dreaded. Every panicked night in Main Stacks. Every time you told yourself, just get through this week. It\u2019s all over.\n\nAnd there is no celebration. No moment that feels big enough. No one waiting for you. You just walk out, alone.\n\nYou wander around campus a bit, not because you need to, but because you cannot go home yet. Everything looks the same, but it no longer feels like yours. You pass by the Campanile. Maybe it\u2019s ringing. You used to find comfort in that sound. Now it just reminds you that time is still moving, even when you feel frozen. You are not headed to class. You are not meeting friends. You are not running late to a section you forgot about. You are just someone walking through a place that is starting to forget you.\n\nSproul is still full of life, but you are not one of them anymore. You move through the crowd like a ghost. You are invisible in the place that once made you feel seen. You pass buildings that hold too many memories in your freshman year. Dwinelle, with its endless hallways and its always-broken elevators. The way you used to get lost even in your junior year. The way it smelled like stress and old chalk and the way it held a hundred of your quiet, forgettable days. Wheeler, you can still picture where you used to sit. Which rows you claimed. Who sat beside you.\n\nMoffitt, more than just a library. It was a second home. You studied there. You cried there. You napped in chairs that were too uncomfortable and somehow still comforting. You watched the sun rise once, maybe twice, after staying all night for a final or midterm you thought would break you. You shared looks with your secret library crush across long tables... The ones that never turned into anything. The stranger you kept seeing on the fourth floor, always headphones in, lost in their own world. The two of you shared the same space, the same time, the same struggle, and maybe something else too. You never spoke. You always thought maybe next time. And then time ran out. They\u2019re gone now. Or maybe they\u2019re still here. Either way, that version of the story never got written. It lingers in your mind like a question you\u2019ll never answer. A softness that never became anything more.\n\nNow, those places feel like closed doors. Like the campus is gently but firmly telling you it is time to go. Not in anger, not in rejection, but because it has to keep going. And you are no longer part of that motion. And you know that the next time you come back, if you ever do, it will not be the same. The buildings you knew will change. Some will be torn down. Others will rise in their place, sleek and unfamiliar. Your old classrooms may be demolished, your favorite corners renovated. The people will be different. The energy will be younger. The world will move on without you, and Berkeley will too.\n\nThe glade will still be green. The sun will still set over the Bay with that soft orange glow. But you will not be running to class or waving to a friend or finding a spot on the lawn with your lunch. You will just be visiting. A stranger to the new students. A memory to the old ones. And no one will know what this place meant to you. No one will know where you used to sit or cry or laugh. No one will remember your version of Berkeley, because that version lived and ended with you.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nThen commencement week arrives. And it is supposed to be joyful. Everyone is in caps and gowns, families cheering, people crying and hugging in the stadium, trying to capture something that is already slipping away. You smile for the pictures. You laugh with friends. You go along with it, because that is what you are supposed to do. But inside, it feels like you are watching it all from far away. Like the moment is happening to someone else.\n\nYou try to feel proud. You try to feel excited. But mostly, you feel... nothing. Or too much, all at once. A strange mix of relief and emptiness, like you finally reached the end of a very long, very hard road, only to find yourself standing still. You thought it would feel different. You thought you would cry. Or feel something big. Instead, it all just feels quiet. Like you are floating through it. Like you are already starting to disappear.\n\nAt your department\u2019s ceremony at Greek Theatre, you sit surrounded by your classmates, people you shared lectures with, passed in hallways, maybe even shared late nights in the library with... and you realize this might be the first time you are hearing some of their names. You look around and see so many familiar faces, people you saw again and again over the years but never really knew. You shared time with them. four years of your life. And now they are walking across the stage, one by one, and you know this might be the last time you ever see them. You clap for them. You smile when your name is called. You walk the stage. You do everything right. But even as you do, there is a voice in the back of your mind asking quietly, is this really it? Four years. Hundreds of lectures. Thousands of hours. All those late nights. All that effort. And now you are just... done.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nAnd then you think of your friends. The ones you saw almost every day. The ones you studied with until 2 a.m. in Main Stacks or camped out with in the depressing reading rooms before finals. The ones you grabbed late-night boba with, sat with on the glade doing absolutely nothing. You might still have the same chat group. You might promise to visit, to FaceTime, to stay in touch. But deep down you know how life works. Everyone will leave. Everyone will start jobs, move to new cities, fly to new countries. People change. People drift. It might be years before you see some of them again. And for others, this might really be the last time. That thought sinks in quietly. But it stays. And it hurts.\n\nIt\u2019s time to pack. You roll up old posters. Fold clothes you wore to classes you forgot you ever took. You throw out lecture notes or cheat sheets you once thought you would keep forever. You look out your window one last time. The streets below are still alive, but you are already somewhere else in your mind. You take a walk down Telegraph or through Southside, past Raleigh\u2019s, past those little shops you never got around to visiting. Past the restaurants you always meant to try. And you realize that this version of Berkeley, the one you knew, only exists in your memory now.\n\nWhen you finally leave, it feels unreal. You think back to the first day you moved in. GBO Week, when everything felt too loud and too new. Your first lecture in a massive hall where you felt like no one would ever know your name. The first time you felt like you belonged. Your first fail midterm. Your first win. It all plays in your head like scenes from someone else\u2019s life. You do not know how to feel. Everything comes at once. You feel proud and empty. Grateful and afraid. Full of love for this place, and somehow hollow at the same time.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nAnd the hardest part?\n\nThere is no more routine. No more rushing out the door for your 8 a.m. in Wheeler, half-awake . No more sitting through back-to-back lectures in VLSB or Cory, trying to stay focused while your mind drifts. No more Canvas notifications reminding you of deadlines you already missed. No more waiting for office hours in crowded hallways, hoping a GSI can save your grade with one more regrade request. There is no more Gradescope eating your homework submission or telling you the deadline passed thirty seconds ago.\n\nNo more bCourses tabs left open for weeks, filled with lecture slides you promised you\u2019d review one day. And now, all of it... all those tabs, all those bookmarks... you quietly close them one by one. Just like that. The last traces of your academic life erased from your screen. There are no more meal swipes. No more grabbing boba with friends and running into someone you know.\n\nNo more waiting in line at Yali\u2019s or Raleigh\u2019s or peeking into MLK hoping to find an open table. No more sitting on the steps near Campanile as the sun sets behind golden gate bridge, watching the sky turn soft and golden, pretending the moment could last forever. No more borrowing mac chargers or frantically looking for outlets. No more pulling each other through finals with late-night La Burrita and quiet reassurances of \u201c*we\u2019ll be okay..*.\u201d\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\n**It hurts...** It is okay to feel numb. It is okay to feel lost. You are grieving something real, even if no one calls it that. This is not just the end of school. It is the end of a life you built from scratch. A version of you that only existed here, in this exact place, surrounded by the people and the moments that shaped you.\n\n**And if it still hurts**, it just means it mattered. It means you loved something deeply. It means Berkeley was never just a campus. It was a home. A place that held your laughter, your stress, your growth, your failures, your joy. A place that will never fully understand what it meant to you, but one that quietly witnessed your becoming.\n\n**So let it hurt.** Let yourself miss it. Take a slow walk through campus if you still can. Look at the Campanile one last time. Breathe in the late spring air. Say goodbye in whatever way feels right. And when it is time to leave, know that your version of Berkeley will live with you forever.\n\nYou are not alone in this sadness. Not now. Not ever.\n\nGo Bears. Always. >!(Fuck Stanford)!<\n\nClass of 2025! Thanks for taking the time to read all of this :'( it really means a lot. I know it\u2019s kind of a mess, just me trying to put scattered thoughts and feelings into words. I hope even a part of this resonated with you. Maybe save it and revisit it in a few weeks, or a few months. When things settle a bit, when the noise in your head quiets down, this might hit in a different way.",

      "title": "UC Berkeley or Emerson College?",
      "content": "I am at a crossroads and would love to hear some opinions; I can\u2019t decide between Emerson journalism and UC Berkeley art history. \n\nI transferred into Emerson out of CC have already gone for 1 year, but my family\u2019s financial situation changed and made it so I couldn\u2019t afford the rest ~year and a half of my education there. I applied as a transfer to a few other institutions as a transfer again and got into UC Berkeley for my second-choice major of art history. I also got into SLC with a huge scholarship and Davis for practically free, amongst a few other schools, but Berkeley is still my top choice of the new pool of schools. \n\nI love journalism and have done a hell of a lot at Emerson (I run a co-curricular student org, I have 2 on campus jobs that I love, I do very well academically, started a band w some friends that\u2019s doing well locally). I\u2019d been pretty prepared to leave per the financial situation, but I was in a car crash that I got a huge payout for that could now comfortably pay for my last year and a half at Emerson with money still left in the bank. However, Berkeley is Berkeley, and I\u2019m a California resident so the tuition would be WAYYY cheaper than Emerson (even if I can pay for it now). \n\nI care a lot about my academics, and one of the few complaints I have about Emerson is the insanely low motivation amidst the student body. I don\u2019t know many students who strive for a lot there, and I feel like a lot of the student population is just kids with exorbitantly rich parents who are just kinda coasting because it\u2019s a pre-professional school. To that point, I also feel like there\u2019s an insane amount of immaturity at Emerson, it just feels like high school (I do a pretty good job at staying away from it but still). I also don\u2019t like that Emerson students are always at war with the faculty (and I hate how incompetent a lot of the upper-management of the school is). On admitted student tours, Emerson students will regularly interrupt and tell prospects not to come here. Even so, I still perform pretty highly there, and I feel good about what I\u2019ve done so far. \n\n\nAt Berkeley, I feel like I\u2019d be surrounded by likeminded people from incredibly diverse backgrounds, which I think is just a valuable thing when speaking to the worldliness of the student body. Plus, the educational opportunities are just insane regardless of the major, and I really admire that. There is also an incredibly tremendous and obvious benefit to the cheaper tuition and to the prestige of the school. I also understand that their STEM program is what they\u2019re known for, but their humanities are still very strong. I do worry about the Art History major as opposed to journalism; my goal for years has been to become and arts and culture critic/entertainment journalist post-grad, which I feel pretty confident about if I stayed at Emerson, and I worry about the post-grad job prospects at Berkeley. I also know I\u2019d have to get my masters for Art History if I wanted a job in that field, which I wouldn\u2019t mind because I\u2019d love to do curatorial, programmatic, or archival work, especially as it pertains to repertory cinemas\u2014and Berkeley has the BAMPFA which is just insane (and they\u2019re doing a Robert Altman retrospective right now\u2026 he\u2019s my favorite!!) But lots of those jobs are fewer and farther between. Also, every student I\u2019ve spoken to has said it\u2019s hard but rewarding to be at Cal and that they love it.\n\nAt Emerson, I feel like internships and jobs will come (and have come) pretty easily to me because I work so hard there, but I worry about internship opportunities (especially in art history) at Berkeley because everyone is such a high performing student. I know that many art historians go on to be writers, and Berkeley has a TON of alumni at major entertainment trades, but Emerson does too. I\u2019ve noticed that Berkeley and Emerson market themselves similarly (great student orgs, versatile education, study abroad opportunities, strong alumni network, having \u201cthe name\u201d) but the major differences come down to how the schools\u2019 respective student bodies engage with those opportunities. \n\nI really don\u2019t know and I have a couple of days to decide. I feel like I\u2019d be happy at either, but would also worry about leaving behind the other. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!!!!\n\n\n\nTLDR: I\u2019ve been at Emerson for journalism for a year and like it but thought I couldn\u2019t afford it going forward so I applied around as a transfer and got into Berkeley for Art History. They both have super strong alumni network and I\u2019ve built a super strong resum\u00e9 in journalism out of emerson (long term goal to be an entertainment writer) but I love the culture and educational opportunities at Berkeley.

Foothill was also too far. Unit 3 has worse amenities (study lounge on odd floors, no laundry room on each floor).\n\n  \nBlackwell Pros:\n\n* Very clean and maintained frequently\n* Bathrooms (toilets and showers are their own rooms doored off)\n* Kitchen, study lounge, laundry, garbage on every floor.\n* Super close to campus (one block away)\n* Very nice gym (RSF is gonna be too packed in the fall and the other gyms are smaller so this is a big plus)\n* Quieter at night?\n\nBlackwell Cons:\n\n* Socially dead\n* Feels like a hotel and not a dorm\n\n  \nUnit 1 Pros:\n\n* Extremely social (probably the most social out of all dorms?)\n* Very communal, entire floor knows each other\n* Right next to crossroads\n* Still very close to campus\n\nUnit 1 Cons:\n\n* Older facility, not as much amenities as Blackwell\n* No single bathroom\n* Louder in the dorms?\n\nFor more info, I have housing priority so I may be able to secure Blackwell if it's my first option. I also live 15 minutes away and I'm going into the dorms for that social aspect and to meet new people. I feel that in Blackwell it's what I make out of it. If I'm social and outgoing can I make my floor social and outgoing? There's no way it's just completely dead in there right? If anyone can give further insight on this I'd greatly appreciate it.",

I submitted a RTV but I honestly have no idea what the chances are it will be approved. It's still over 2 months until move in.

I am down with a cancelation fee but I have a terrible feeling I'm going to be stuck for an entire year if they have to fill the whole location (761 students) vs just any new app.\n\nHas anyone been granted a release of a grad student apartment at any point during their lease?

But I have two concerns - will the bus route be too long? I am thinking it's probably fine since it's free and I can read or catch up emails etc on the bus. But I will also have a car - needed for weekends etc and I am driving it from FL - how much will parking at the apartments cost (separate from costs to park near the law school.) It's only for a year but I am hoping there are grad students around? Some reddit posts make it sound like a ghost town. $1600 a month for laundry in the apartment and furnished and with a gym does not sound like the worst deal. Thoughts?

      "content": "It all started when I (a dude) first got to my first Physics lecture here, I approached the door to the Physics 1 room, gasping in awe at such a scene\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8. I mean it was just like the movies. \u2b50Such elegance and grandeur\u2b50. So with excitement and feeling whimsical, I (basically, could say it happened but imagine in more of an exaggerated way) \ud83d\udd7a \ud83d\udd7a \ud83d\udd7a \ud83d\udd7askipped and skipped up the stairs, to find the perfect seat for my first Physics lecture here at the big UC BERKELEY\ud83c\udfeb\ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udcda\ud83c\udfeb\ud83d\udc3b. It was then I found it\ud83d\udc44, ohhhh, it was beautiful such spacing between me and the professor, so they would not randomly call me for questions, but not so far so that I could not see what they were writing down on the blackboard. Right in the middle so there was symmetry in my view. It was THE perfect seat\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24. With such vigor and expedience\u26a1\u26a1\u26a1, I delivered each cheek to its rightful placement!! \ud83d\ude26\ud83d\ude26\ud83d\ude26It was then .... it happened...... THIS WAS THE WORSE CHAIR I HAVE EVER SAT ON. \n\n I mean I have sat on poles, uneven boulders, FREAKING small miniature bike seats that dug up more than they needed to!!!!! I mean for the love of God, this was a torture device. Not to mention I'm 6'2 (hey ladies \ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\ude09), so this obviously must have been built for the Keebler cookie elves\ud83e\udddd\ud83e\udddd\ud83e\udddd. The guy who sat in Oppenheimer, in one of the UC Berkeley physics chairs lied!!, the chairs were not built for humans!!! They were built small robots with flat and excuse my language, RUMPS!!! It was a small desk, with flat ohh so flat, boards for our bottoms!! I then could not find myself the pleasure of listening in cadence with the professor, it was a disaster, while they went \"blah blah blah\" (\\*charlie brown teacher noises), I went\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d \"OHH MY LORD, PLEASE, MY BUTT IS GOING TO COLLAPSE IN ON ITSELF, WHY ME, WHY ME!!!, Wait how much time is left in this class? \\*checks phone, 53 MINUTES!! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2dOH, I'M GOING TO PASS OUT!!\" After moving around for what felt like forever, this then led me to maneuver my right waist onto the miniature desk table on our right(guess they thought we were writing on detective notebooks or something) and put only my right cheek on (the flat board you can call ) the seat with my feet dangling in the air. This relieved me only some of the pain this device gave me. This was a man-made maneuver I created just then ( guess yall can guess how I got into Berkeley then, heh\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13), going right cheek to left cheek like a Rock climber switching arms on a crevice to relieve the Lactic acid going up their arms. I must have switched sides 20 times!! For one lecture. \n\n\"OH HECKS NAHH BRUH\". Walking in frustration I walked back to my room, \"OH what can a humble, genius, beautiful, dare I say (I do dare), a charming individual like me do about this incursion on my two buttocks???\" With this energy\u26a1\ud83d\udd0b\u26a1 and a backlog of emotion I built up, I decided to hit the gym( I go often, you can tell, trust). \n\n Listening to Led Zepplin, hitting my heavy (a whole 125 lb, heh\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e) bench press, I then saw it, a booty like never before, on an individual you would never believe it from. This man went by the name \"REDACTED\" (I ain't telling you fools his name, just know he had a budonk a donk).  You can just tell by the Rontudness \ud83c\udfd0\ud83c\udfd0\ud83c\udfd0 of his assets\ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udf51 he works them often. \"Eureka\" I said to myself, this was what I was waiting for, a solution!!! Now hear this!! If the world does not bend to my will, then I must ADAPT and become something different. The issue wasn't with how flat or painful the seat was, it was that I did not have the right cushion for the right pushing. (The cushion is my booty cheeks\ud83c\udf51 and the pushing, the painful, excruciating, incomprehensible Normal force (see I do hear some things from my physics courses, you're probably thinking how smart I am, heh\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13) , just wanted to clarify). So I shifted gears and met this glorious man, his aura made me clutch my pearls, and as I whimpered \" Uhh hello sir, .... I just \ud83d\ude30\ud83d\ude30... \\*gulp, wanted to know \ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48 HOW YOU GOT THAT BOOTYLICIOUS, JUNK IN THE TRUNK, CABOOSE GIFTED \ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf81 FROM THE GODS????\"  You can tell he was impressed with my enthusiasm (I do that sometimes, heh\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e), with the movements of his bony, hairy fingers he put up the number four, Giving an almost, stoic look. \\*Me looking at him with a sassy attitude, \"What you want me to do with this, thickems??!!\" He then said in a soft high pitched tone \" I do 100 Hip thrusts, 100 Glute Bridges, 100 squats, and 10 km of lunges, every single day.\" . With this, I left his presence, I knew, there was no time, \"I have to get to work NOW!\" So I got to moving, one squat after another, glute bridge after glute bridge, lunge after lunge, it was torturous and made me push my very limits, but it was nothing compared to that demoralizing, agony-filled\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25, cruel seating device called a desk. I had no time, lecture was in two days. \"oh the humanity\" I cried\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d. Just the thought of sitting in that chair made my heart skip a beat\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94. I was finally done with the workout, time to go home and let the muscles do their thing. I wake up and check the mirror, a high pitched gasp\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31 ensued from my lips (it was a manly gasp though so it redeems itself)..... There was no progress, \"What??\" \"HUH??\" \"Where's the bouncy Hiney at??!?\". Oh, how I cried dreading the very next day .... \n\nThis stage of limbo, went on and on for the next 6 weeks, going to class and losing my sanity\ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd2a, Doing the workout (cuz what else was I going to do), and then it hit finally hit me. Looking in the mirror, I see a bump\ud83d\udc2b\ud83d\udc2b (NO it was not a bug bite), it was like a layer that was added to my cheekies. My confidence came back slightly \"Could this be what I was waiting for?!?\", I ran to class that morning. It was time to show where all my effort went. Approaching my desk I would be lying if I said I had my doubts \"Is your booty too small!!?!\"\ud83d\ude30 \"Is there enough dump in that TRUNK!!? \ud83d\ude30Oh, this was a suspenseful scene, Did I have enough to match my seats FREAK??? \ud83d\ude30\ud83d\ude30\ud83d\ude30Then it happened, cheek-to-seat, like a silent realization\ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude2e when you turn around and see you accidentally set off an avalanche by tooting\ud83d\udca8\ud83d\udca8. \"I am not in pain?\" \"Huh??\" This surely could not be real. Right? I then presumed to bounce up \u2195\ufe0fand down\u2195\ufe0f on it, hitting twirls and tricks on that thang.\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33 \"IT DOESN'T HURT!!!\" \"I DID IT!!\" It was like sitting on a memory foam pillow. Truth be said two tears \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22came out from both eyes\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 at that moment. \n\nNow it's been a year into my time at Berkeley\ud83c\udfeb\ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udcda\ud83c\udfeb\ud83d\udc3b, and following the workout plan I have now achieved optimal Rotundness. I can now sit on those chairs like it's nothing, like cutting cottage cheese with a plastic fork instead of Stale Gouda. Now acting as a guide to all the lil Jits(freshmen) who feast their peepers on my bumpers, wanting to become Big booty bandits like me. I can even crush a watermelon \ud83c\udf49\ud83c\udf49\ud83c\udf49with my thighs now. The only con is when I go to put on my pants\ud83d\udc56\ud83d\udc56, I have to use the little jump and pull-up method because the surface area is too much for my Relaxed fit jeans. End of story.",

      "content": "Hi, hope you are all well. This is a tough decision\u2026 I understand. \n\n\n\nHope this helps! (:\n\n\n\nGeneral answers to frequently asked questions:\n\n\nQ: Is Berkeley \u201ccut-throat\u201d\n\nA: No, not really. Some departments will be more competitive than others and some individuals may be more than others but generally, no.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nQ: Is Berkeley difficult?\n\nA: Yes. All colleges/universities are difficult and getting a degree anywhere takes a lot of work. However, Berkeley is notoriously \u201cfull of academic rigor\u201d for a reason. \n\n_________________________________________\n\nQ: How hard is it to get research opportunities?\n\nA: It depends on the department but generally it is pretty accessible if you talk with people. This is one of the massive benefits of being at Cal. It\u2019ll require effort to \u201cget in\u201d but once you\u2019re \u201cin\u201d it\u2019s hard to stop.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nQ: How\u2019s the social life?\n\nA: I\u2019d say it\u2019s good. Cal isn\u2019t a party school but people do throw parties, socials and other get togethers decently often. There\u2019s a niche for everybody here mostly.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nQ: Is it safe?\n\nA: Yes and no. It\u2019s not the suburbs but it\u2019s also not a huge city. Crime happens here\u2026 be aware and keep your head on a swivel especially at night. I\u2019d honestly try not to walk at night in certain areas alone even as a man. \n\nHowever it\u2019s absolutely not the crime mega center it sometimes gets painted to be. There\u2019s also BearWalk/Safe walk/student CSOs who work through UCPD that are able to walk you places as security.\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nQ: I got a D, F or C on my Spring semester report will I get rescinded?\n\nA: Perhaps yes\u2026 perhaps no. Call the admissions office and ask. Typically if you communicate, have a good reason and if it\u2019s only one grade\u2026 you\u2019re fine. If you don\u2019t communicate or it\u2019s extreme, you may be fine but they may be less merciful.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nQ: I got into ABCD other school, I like Berkeley but would be devastated to not go to ABCD other school.\n\nA: Go to that other school if you truly think you\u2019ll be happier there. Unless you have a really compelling reason to choose Berkeley over that other school. I\u2019d suggest getting advice from a trusted mentor in that case.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nQ: How\u2019s the weather?\n\nA: I like it. Others don\u2019t. It gets chilly and sometimes cold during the winter\u2026 rainy and foggy often (35-70ish Fahrenheit). During the summers it can get somewhat hot (60-100 Fahrenheit) typically with some chilly days. The extrema of both temperatures represent outlying days. All in all the weather is pretty moderate but is relative to your own experience.\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nQ: Is grade deflation real?\n\nA: It\u2019s not as common as people make it out to be but, yes. Depends heavily on the department and even class, professor and the given semester. Generally though yes, it does exist.\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\nQ: Is Berkeley racist?\n\nA: Berkeley is extremely diverse in many ways. \n\nIncidents of individual prejudice/racism however still have occurred on this campus before unfortunately. \n\nThese incidents do not define the overall climate of Berkeley though. Generally, Berkeley is a safe and inclusive campus in an extremely diverse region of the world.\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nQ: How long will it take me to do (XYZ)\n\nA: It probably depends on many factors both individual and general. For the best guideline/knowledge I\u2019d say you should consult your specific department/department of interest web page. Moreover, the general Berkeley website has a lot of information too. Most departments have information on double majoring, concurrent majors and so forth.\n\nIf you want information on things like study abroad, ROTC, participating in certain things which sometimes require extra time/work like theatrical shows\u2026 etc\u2026 then there is typically a unique Berkeley website with pertinent information.\n\nTypically, there are advisors available for everything. In more \u201cuncommon\u201d cases it may be worth asking around as well or posting something once you have a decent idea of what you\u2019re thinking of doing.\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\nQ: Does the prestige of XYZ school VS Berkeley or Berkeley VS XYZ school matter?\n\nA: Yes and no. Prestige is relative. If you are planning on going into academia then yes, generally, it does matter. If you aren\u2019t going into academia/grad school etc.. prestige and renown will still open doors for you and is generally better to have if it\u2019s an option. But is not as important to consider. \n\nIn my opinion prestige shouldn\u2019t be a primary motivator when choosing a school. It absolutely can calculate into your choice though. \n\nIf you are really attracted to the prestige of Cal or another school, i\u2019d say asking yourself \u201cwhy\u201d is a good exercise. Is it the history? Faculty? Alumni? Or something else.\n\nAlso yes, Berkeley is generally perceived and backed up statistically as being prestigious. However there\u2019s so much more to Cal and life in general than prestige honestly.\n_________________________________________\n\n\n***** All in all don\u2019t let external opinion fully guide your choice. Go to the school which will provide you with the best opportunities, development and health (mentally, physically and spiritually). \n\nThere are many\u2026 many rumors, over exaggerated points and so forth surrounding Cal. Realize that while (some) of these are partly true, often they are blown out of proportion. ********\n\nAlso don\u2019t be afraid to ask. This is a general FAQ but if your answer is not here or posted elsewhere already\u2026 ask and get clarification.\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYou can always apply to Berkeley for grad school if you choose to go somewhere else but still want Berkeley, vice versa. You could even come here for a certificate, research or academic exchange\u2026 also vice versa.\n\nUltimately, the choice is yours. Maybe seeing these common Q & A points in one post will help. Maybe it\u2019s just a reiteration of what you\u2019ve already heard. \n\nRegardless, you got this!\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nGo bears! (And so forth)\n\nHave a great or better day\n\n\nP.s. - These are just points from my personal\nobservations and experiences. Others may have different input.",

      "title": "My reflection on NST 160 (aka NUSCTX 160)",
      "content": "TL;DR - Not-so-easy midterms, but cheatsheets allowed. No lecture attendance taken. Very generous curves. Course content is highly relevant for future health-professionals.\n\nFor those who wish to take this class, I recommend taking NST 160 *after* you finish whatever biochemistry sequence your major makes you pursue (MCB 102 or MCB 100A/B or Chem 135...). Actually, the more classes after biochemistry (cell bio, physiology, cancer bio, immunology... you name it) you take, the better it is for you. The class begins with how mTOR regulates translational regulation coupled with insulin pathway. If you are not familiar with how mammalian cells initiate, maintain, and terminate translation, not to mention transcription, you are sunk from the first lecture. You'll wish you had physiology knowledge when you are learning lipoprotein pathway. You'll wish you had immunology background when you are learning about the effects of omega-3 fatty acids in our body. You *can* still succeed in the course only with Bio 1A background. However, to fully appreciate the content, you'd wanna delay taking it as much as possible. It'll be a whole different experience. Trust me, I took this course right after Bio 1A and *with* MCB 102. I was shocked by the knowledge gap between Bio 1A and NST 160. You *are* able to enroll NST 160 without biochemistry, and you *can* do well without biochemistry, but I strongly advise against it.\n\nI think it's best to take NST 160 on the Spring semester of your last year, so that it'd be by the time that you would've seen all the basic stuffs so far, like physiology, immunology, cell biology, or cancer biology if you have taken it (although, contrary to popular belief, you don't need NST 103 knowledge for this course. It might help, but what they teach here is very different from what you learn in 103). Your understanding of the material will be *significantly* enhanced if you have all the background knowledge. So this class is *not* for you guys, and I'm talking to you, first-years and second-years who are still stuck with organic chemistry homework problem sets.\n\nThis class is full of pathways after pathways. Lipoprotein pathways, insulin resistance pathways, mTOR pathways, iron homeostasis pathways, ER stress pathways... I'm pretty sure there are twice more pathways we need to know other than the ones I listed. If you are studying for midterms, you might be spending most of your time drawing, in a desperate attempt to understand the piles of the pathways that they fire-hosed down to your throat.\n\nHowever, what makes this class manageable is that you're allowed to have cheatsheets. Which means, you don't need to memorize everything! All you need to do is to have a general understanding. It won't be too bad if you were able to at least understand what's going on. Three midterms and one final, so you'd be sitting for four exams for this course.\n\nI think this course is very useful for anyone who's interested in general human health. Even if you are certain that you want to specialize in dermatology or neurology so you feel you don't need to know what diabetes is, yes, NST 160 knowledge probably won't be in your day-to-day language, but what if one of your relatives want some medical advice/tips on how to live a healthy life, or ask you to make food choices on their diet plan, what would you tell them? I think this class allows you have a totally new appreciation and understanding of human health in general. Human health is not just whatever scientists and medical professionals tell you. Eating fruits and vegetables, touching grass and hitting the gym, having a quality sleep, reducing your red meat intake... yeah that's all fine and good, but *why*? Why should we eat lots of fruits, why should we have physical exercise, why it's crucial to keep up with body rhythm, and why consuming red meat might not be the best choice? Are you able to explain them in a more deeper level than whatever mass-media, magazines, or social media tells you?\n\nYou'd be able to explain circadian rhythm and sleep based on certain genes and the molecular factors that might disrupt it. You'd be able to understand insulin resistance molecularly, so you'd be able to predict what kinds of foods or lifestyles are the worst in exacerbating it. You'll be able to explain why fibers in vegetables are great with a connection to microbiome in your gut. You'll be able to see vitamins and fatty acids in a totally different way, from some magical stuff in pills that somehow mysteriously improves our health, into some chemicals that we can manipulate to induce some changes in the chemistry in our body. You'll be able to explain *hunger* itself. You'll be able to fully explain how GLP-1 agonists (wegovy, ozempic...) does their job of addressing diabetes and weight loss as a side effect. Yeah, all the important stuff to know if you wish to become a health professional in future.\n\nLook at the past course distributions. I'd say this course is pretty manageable, isn't it? The curve in my opinion is *very* generous, assuming from the midterm averages, SD, and the guaranteed grade listed on the syllabus.\n\nNST 160 content won't be that easy, nor the exams are easy A's. However, if you are interested in health in general, and later wish to have a job that *requires* you to explain human health to others (like doctors), NST 160 is a great course to take!",

      "title": "Two cents on Data 104 (History 184D)",
      "content": "Before diving in, I want to make it clear that these are just my personal thoughts, based on my experience as a STEM major who took this course last fall alongside a pretty reasonable workload. I managed to earn an A, which, in my opinion, shows I had, from a certain point of view, a reasonable understanding of the material and what the class was about. In other words, I\u2019m not coming at this from a place of complete cluelessness. With that said, I know there will be differing views on this class, each one being equally valid given a similar depths of experience shared by all of us. With that out of the way, let\u2019s get into it.\n\n\n\nFor me, the most important part of any class is the content we cover throughout the semester. If the material is engaging and enjoyable, I can usually overlook other issues, like a mediocre instructor, tons of homework, or harsh grading. In this case, I think the class did a decent job. A lot of the readings were genuinely interesting, and the case studies were super relevant to what we were discussing. They were the right length\u2014not too long to feel like a slog, but deep enough to spark good conversations and make one think. \n\n\n\nThat, unfortunately, is where the class fell short. The sheer volume of the readings (3-6) per week made it impossible to discuss these readings at a reasonable depth, neither in lectures nor in discussion. With the weekly warm-ups, readings often became a game of smart retention and focused regurgitation; but more on this later. For now, this rushed approach to readings, combined with the increasing obfuscation (e.g. the infamous anatomy of AI reading, or the Feminist Manifest-no) later in the semester stole a considerable amount of insightful discussion from us. This was done in favor of rushing through a couple thought-provoking questions developed by the TA in less than 10 minutes due to time constraints. There was minimal integration between readings (only the recidivism theme comes to mind), and the integration done in lecture could not be followed on as a discussion. The result here was brushing through some pretty significant concepts in Human Contexts and Ethics (HCE) in favor of tying to cover as much content as possible.\n\nTL;DR for this point - Too many readings, not enough time spent per reading to do them justice.\n\n\n\nMoving from the content to the assignments - I don't have words to describe how much I despised this part of the course. Our semester had weekly warm-ups, which essentially meant spending the first ten minutes of discussion writing 100 or so words on a random detail in a random reading from the previous week. It isn't my place to question the reasoning behind this exercise, but it doesn't take a genius to guess that it was to promote thorough reading. On the  It quickly became a game of who can retain the most shite from a reading in the least amount of time. Most people I knew spent half an hour before discussions memorizing trivia from the readings, to regurgitate it on the warm-up response, completely missing any nuance in the reading. The warm-ups and ensuing discussion sections were a game of how much trivia can you spout while acting social-sciency in terminology, and many who succeeded imbibed absolutely nothing from the course. \n\n\n\nThe two analysis essays, while being disliked by many STEM majors (who are averse to writing prose), were pretty good, with the prompts being a lot of fun to research on. That said, it was ridiculously easy to cheese them, and I wrote both my essays (with no research or prior memory of any reading) in less than three hours, before the deadline. A build-up with essay drafts, submission outlines, annotated bibliographies, would be beneficial to ensure cheeses like this don't happen (although no complaints on my end lol). I understand that these imply more work for both students and course staff (and hence might be unpopular), but given the time provided for each essay, this increase in workload is reasonable. \n\n\n\nComing to the exams - one midterm and one final. My whole litany of swears is not enough to describe my acrimony towards the examinations. Four questions on both exams, so eight in total. Every single one of these questions was pure pain to respond to. Most questions were severely hinged on one reading each, a problem particularly strong in the midterm. This meant that we were essentially expected to memorize content from roughly 30 readings for the midterm, and 60 for the final. Absolute, blind, rote memorization, with liturgical regurgitation being the preferred response form on the exam. Blind application of the HCE Toolkit (A collection of 10 or so terms that are linked to STEM ethics), with shoehorning of concepts to link an incoherent mess of concepts from a single reading to the expected outcome that the question expects us to draw (loaded questions were the norm rather than the exception). Not a single one of these questions promoted anything remotely linked to analyzing HCE, rather encouraging us to become trivia bots and walking memory banks of case studies. Honestly, give chatGPT the exams, and my guess is that it will do better than most students. \n\n\n\nI have a lot of vitriol towards this course (as I hope is evident by now), but none of that is directed at course staff. I have nothing but positive things to say about the TAs and readers. My TA in particular was singlehandedly responsible for making the class tolerable, and the readers/evalulators were reasonably quick with gradings. They all tried their best, and I am extremely grateful to them. The instructors, from my view, were also reasonable, and provided a considerable amount of support to anyone who wanted to succeed in the course. I did not make full use of this (given my fatigue with the course as is), but it is comforting to kow that it was there. That said, I would love to hear from someone who actually went to the review sessions and essay workshops, about their experiences.\n\n\n\nAs the course stands right now, it is riddled with flaws. It emphasizes learning the wrong concepts, makes ethics (an already unpopular topic for STEM students to study of their own volition) a chore, severely encourages gaming the system and has an all around terrible grading system. The course staff, while supportive for the most part and working to design the course with best intentions, needs to do a complete overhaul of the pedagogy. Some (very brief) suggestions would be changing the exam format to be one open ended question on a theme (one of the five over the semester), adding more checkpoints to analyses essays, getting rid of the warm-ups and increasing the amount of discussion time (perhaps infeasible, just throwing it out there.). \n\n\n\nOn a fundamental level, overlooking all logistics, I believe an ethics course is absolutely essential for any DS major. The content taught in this course is excellent for its own sake (independent from how it's taught, how it's tested and other such concerns). The problem lies entirely in the execution, which if addressed over the coming semesters, would transform this course from a chore to something to look forward to. \n\n\n\nWith respect,\n\nSomeone with too much time on their hands.",

      "title": "tips for Data 140!",
      "content": "I just took Data 140 with Prof Adhikari this past semester and wanted to share a few tips for future students! I personally found Data 140 to be both rigorous and rewarding, but I think my experience could have been a lot smoother if I had known a few things before the class started. For some background, I took CS 70 a year ago but I felt that I did not learn probability theory well enough lol (and it was always interesting to me), so I wanted to strengthen my understanding in that area.\n\n* **Don't underestimate the course load of this class.** Labs and homework are graded by accuracy and there is no gracious 70-80% rule like in other p-set CS classes. There was a HW and lab due every week on new material which was stressful with my other 2 CS upperdivs. Sometimes the lab was harder than the HW lol so definitely pace yourself.\n   * My personal schedule was to finish the lab on Thursday with my partner and finish the HW Friday-Sunday.\n* **Read and understand the textbook.** I don't think I've ever seen another class with such a great internal resource that directly helps with the HW/labs/exams. For exams, I realized I learned the best when I just spammed the \"Exercises\" page in each chapter since they were usually reflective of exam problem difficulty.\n* **Go to the discussion and mega-sections every week.** These 1 hour blocks just spammed practice problems which again just really helps with building that intuition and mapped to the kinds of problems on the lab and HW that week. For the few weeks that I missed them, I was lowkey very lost lol so just force yourself to go.\n* **Actually go to lecture (they are not recorded).** The one thing I really regret was sleeping too late the night before and then missing the lecture the next morning too many times for Data 140. For the times I went, Prof Adhikari was great at explaining new topics and built that necessary foundational understanding during those 90 mins. I never felt that I was wasting my time while at a lecture so definitely go!\n* **Go to HW party.** These were every Friday and just a great time to force myself to finish half the HW and learn more by discussing ideas with the TAs/other students. Again, HW can take really long, especially at the start of the course when you lack that probability intuition.\n* **Use office hours.** This is a given for any course, but most of the Data 140 staff were so amazing at not just helping me solve the HW problem but also helping me build the intuition to solve those kinds of problems in general.\n* **Don't count yourself out after the first midterm!** I bombed the first midterm and remember feeling extremely discouraged and stressed lol. The issue was with how I studied since I did not do enough practice problems from the textbook (only did the 2 practice tests). I managed to do better on the second midterm and even better on the final, so improvement is totally doable.\n* **Brush up on calculus and linear algebra.** I wouldn't say there was too much of it but they definitely do assume this knowledge from you, so make sure you are comfortable with them beforehand.\n* **Make friends or come into the class with friends.** Again, this is a given for any class but I found that having friends to bounce ideas off of was really helpful for building my understanding. I had two friends in the class, and we hosted a final review session just for ourselves where we just spammed + discussed practice problems together for 2 hours in Moffit lol. I wish we did it for the midterms too because it was really helpful.\n\nOverall I feel that I got a lot more out of Data 140 than CS 70's probability portion which was rushed imo. While it was a lot of work, I would still recommend this class to anyone as it felt well-supported, had interesting content, and was led by a goated lecturer. Hope this helps for future students!",

I\u2019m self-aware about being unmotivated, and while I\u2019m working on it, I know it\u2019s been a major weakness. I tend to wing my homework and hope for the best.\n\nSometimes I cope by telling myself, \"If I really studied, I\u2019d have done better.\" Maybe, on some level, I subconsciously don\u2019t study to leave myself that excuse when I fall short. Regardless, I know I need to change. \n\nNow, I\u2019m graduating with a GPA somewhere above 3.0 but below 3.7. My transcript has every letter of the alphabet, and I\u2019m still unemployed. I don\u2019t feel proud of my accomplishments. I\u2019m not saying a higher GPA would\u2019ve fixed everything; after all, there are incredibly accomplished people with worse GPAs than mine. But my GPA feels like a microcosm of my broader problem: I\u2019ve grown too comfortable with not pushing myself to be my best.\n\nThe phrase \"C\u2019s get degrees\" might be funny and true in some contexts, but it shouldn\u2019t be taken as an excuse to coast. Getting C\u2019s is fine if you\u2019re genuinely giving your all and that\u2019s where you land. But if you\u2019re struggling because you lack motivation, focus, or mental clarity, it\u2019s okay\u2014and even necessary\u2014to pause, reassess, and rebuild. Taking a gap year or dropping out temporarily to work on yourself should be normalized. It\u2019s not failure; it\u2019s setting yourself up for success when you\u2019re ready.\n\nI feel people see taking time off as equivalent to failing out of school, but it\u2019s not. Don\u2019t let others\u2019 judgments stop you from making the right decision for yourself. Use that time to develop better habits and a healthier mindset, so when you return, you can succeed on your terms. \n\nI wish someone had told me this four ago.",

      "content": "I transferred to Berkeley from CC in 2021, graduated Spring 2024. Berkeley was... whew, it was a lot! But it was also a really unique place, and I wish I'd taken advantage of my time there just a bit more. \n\n  \nBack when I transferred, I was aware that Cal had a sailing team, and - having been a sea scout once upon a time - I really wanted to join. I dearly missed being out on the water! I was under the impression for nearly all of my time in attendance, though, that one had to have been recruited from high school to be on the team. I saw a section on the team website about HS seniors reaching out a year in advance, and I guess I just figured sports at Cal were competitive enough that me, a slightly older transfer, with my admittedly rusty, ho-hum sailing skills would be turned away if I showed up interested in joining. So I didn't even reach out, and I spent the whole time I was there wishing I had a sport, a club, an activity that kept both my brain and body busy and provided me with a social outlet. Yeah, I'd occasionally bus down to the marina and take out a kayak for an hour, but it wasn't the same. \n\n  \nI've realized, since graduating, that it wasn't like I thought and I might have had a fair shot at actually being on the team had I pursued it. I mean, I've raced before. I'm not *good*, but I can function on a boat. My scouting program had a little laser we'd screw around on in the summer - just little jaunts back and forth on the Delta. Now I'm regretting not being more tenacious about it or reaching out when I had the chance. I'll never be an undergrad again (and therefore eligible to compete in the ICSA races), and darn it! I wish I'd known a few years ago what I do now because I probably would have had a much more pleasurable time at Berkeley! \n\n\n\nIt's a silly little thing, and I can definitely join a local sailing club as an adult now. But !!! I could've actually done the thing I wanted while I was at Cal??????? And I didn't know that till after I left???????? Booooo, big sad!\n\n  \nAnyway, **a word of advice to inbound and current Bears:** when it comes to pursuing cool opportunities, ASK about your eligibility if you're unsure. There's a reputation that all clubs and extracurriculars are impossible to join, but that's not always true. In fact, I found it was rarely true except for in the case of consulting firms, pre-law frats, and maybe Greek life to a certain extent. Don't inadvertently deprive yourself of something you'd love to do because you were a doofus and *assumed* the answer would be \"no\". It might be a yes, and a year on from graduation, you might be like me, sitting with silly little regrets if you don't at least try. \n\n  \nGod, my poorly funded little grad school in the middle of nowhere makes me miss Berkeley a little more every day. ENJOY YOUR TIME HERE. Yes, homework and obligations will always be there. There will *always* be demands on your time. But certain opportunities will only be open to you as an undergraduate at a top university, with a big endowment like Cal; take advantage of those opportunities while you can. :) \n\n  \nFiat Lux, friends \ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9b",

      "title": "Let's Discuss Upcoming UCPD Encryption",
      "content": "For those who don\u2019t know me, I ran the ScanBerkeley account (@scanberkeley) while I was a student here (graduated in December 2023). *Not to be confused with The Berkeley Scanner (we\u2019re totally separate)*. ScanBerkeley was dedicated to monitoring and sharing urgent public safety info from UCPD, Berkeley PD, and Berkeley FD radio traffic. I wanted to post here about something that\u2019s about to impact public safety and transparency for everyone at UC Berkeley.\n\n  \nUCPD is now planning to encrypt their main dispatch radio channels along with most agencies around the East Bay. They \"claim\" this is required by a DOJ mandate regarding personal information. That is false. Units can run information via their vehicle computers (MDTs) and be in full compliance. They can use a second channel (which BPD already does). They can even \"break\" apart transmissions so information is not sent together, and still be in full compliance.\n\nHere is a section of the requirement to be in compliance: \n\n>\u201cEstablish policy to restrict dissemination of specific information that would provide for the protection of restricted CJI database information and combinations of name and other data elements that meet the definition of PII. This will provide for the protection of CJI and PII while allowing for radio traffic with the information necessary to provide public safety.\u201d\n\n\u00a0*(Source: California DOJ Information Bulletin, Confidentiality of CLETS Information, p. 2; FBI CJIS Security Policy Sections 5.10.1.2 & 5.13.1.1)*\n\n  \nWhy does this matter?\n\n* UCPD\u2019s real-time notification system has major issues. For years, WarnMe alerts have been vague, delayed, or missing critical context. If you\u2019ve ever received a generic \u201cpolice activity in the area\u201d message, you know how unhelpful that can be in a real emergency.\n* There have been many incidents where UCPD\u2019s official alerts excluded key descriptions like the suspect race, locations, etc. In many of these cases, I was able to provide that information within seconds of a dispatch, while the campus community waited hours (or never received an update) from official sources.\n* Open dispatch channels allow nearby police, fire, and emergency services (EOCs) to stay aware of ongoing incidents and respond more effectively. Full encryption makes cross-agency coordination harder, slows down emergency responses, and ultimately undermines community safety. *(FUN FACT: Campus staff/response personnel even used my tweets during an active incident once because PD took so long to tell them. Will key staff get encrypted radio access? Doubt it.)*\n\n\n\nWhat about officer safety? What if criminals are listening?\n\nWhile this is a valid worry in certain tactical situations, most agencies already handle sensitive operations on separate encrypted tactical channels, keeping the main dispatch open for routine calls. In practice, general dispatch rarely includes the kind of information that would compromise officer safety, and any critical details can be quickly moved to a secure channel if needed. It\u2019s also important to understand that even with full voice encryption, the control channels used by digital radio systems remain unencrypted. These control channels still reveal which radio IDs are active, which talkgroups are being used, and when units are transmitting. With the right tools and some research, someone could still monitor patterns and activity.\n\n\n\nFinal argument, IT IS ALL PUBLIC RECORDS! Anyone can request the audio. All this changes is some intern will likely need to go redact small portions of the radio traffic. Only major issue with this, is UC Berkeley's public records takes months to return. (I am still waiting for some from 2 years ago).\n\n\n\nThanks to a city council resolution, **Berkeley PD is required to keep their primary dispatch open to the public.** ([https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2021-09-28%20Item%2018%20Lease%20Agreement%20with%20Motorola%20-%20Supp%20Harrison.pdf](https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2021-09-28%20Item%2018%20Lease%20Agreement%20with%20Motorola%20-%20Supp%20Harrison.pdf)) There are no current plans to encrypt the fire department radio traffic. UCPD is not subject to these restrictions. To be clear, TAC channels should be encrypted. Tactical incidents can always be moved to a secondary channel. I am only pushing for dispatch to remain open.\n\n\n\nIf you care about this, now is the time to speak up. Contact the Chancellor, ASUC, UCPD Accountability Board, and tell them you want UCPD to keep dispatch channels open like Berkeley PD will be doing. Anyway, happy to discuss more below. :)",

Instead, I received a standard double bedroom at Martinez Commons RH. While I understand that Martinez offers great facilities and is convenient, I just personally prefer not to share a bedroom.\n\nI noticed that my financial aid package shows about a $5000 difference per year between on-campus and off-campus living. One complication is that I have my own car, so if I live in RH, I will need to pay for overnight parking on campus, which might not be that beneficial. \n\nIf I accept the offer and submit the housing relocation form for the second round, will it be difficult to get a single bedroom within the dorm apartments? If the second round doesn\u2019t meet my needs, can I cancel the offer afterward? The instructions mentioned that I need to accept the offer to submit the relocation form...\n\nI\u2019ve been looking into studio or 1-bed options with in unit laundry and parking within the monthly rent of $2000-$2500 on apartment rental sites, in case I can\u2019t get a single room in the dorms. It seems that the Oakland area has some reasonably priced luxury apartments, but I\u2019ve heard concerns about public safety. \n\nMy concern I have is regarding mandatory income requirements for most apartments. I\u2019ve noticed that many apartments require an income of x2.5 to x3 the rent, but I fall below that threshold. I will also be quitting my job this month as I need to move from LA to Berkeley.

      "content": "I gave myself time on my morning walk today to destress before finals, but more importantly having some time alone gave me perspective on what it means to be here and other top schools\n\nOut of 8,000,000,000 people 45,000 people attend Berkeley: or about 0.00056% of the population. \n\nOut of 45,000 people I live in a housing unit that\u2019s great and welcoming and houses only 854 or 0.000011% of the population and only 1.9% of Berkeley\u2019s student body.\n\nI was paired with great roommates, a great view and room. The latter two are a 1/8 chance and a 1/2 chance, respectively. My roommates are great so let\u2019s say finding good roommates here is 4/5\n\nThis all works out to my situation in particular to be 0.0000010675% of the population or 1 in 93.69 million.\n\nThis isn\u2019t even accounting for my personal privileges and experiences that have set me to be ahead in life\n\nTo be able to be here and rub shoulders with some of the brightest minds in the world is such a blessing. Religious connotations are put into that word but I don\u2019t mean it like that. Just to be here is such a privilege\n\nAre there things, especially the crime rate that need to be addressed? Really it isn\u2019t able to be ignored. Are there tragic things that happen? All the time. Nothing of this post is trying to make less light of what issues we do have, but I do want us to remember we have always been and continue to move forward. What we consider normal now were issues for us decades prior\n\nWith finals and RRR week\u2014 if you\u2019re stressing\u2014 it would not be an imprudent idea to give ourselves some time to organize and destress with some perspective; I will work hard and grind, but I am so happy I am here even able to worry about having worries \nHappy Sunday \n\ud83d\udc3b \u2600\ufe0f",

      "content": "Hi, hope you are all well. This is a tough decision\u2026 I understand. \n\n\n\nHope this helps! (:\n\n\n\nGeneral answers to frequently asked questions:\n\n\nQ: Is Berkeley \u201ccut-throat\u201d\n\nA: No, not really. Some departments will be more competitive than others and some individuals may be more than others but generally, no.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nQ: Is Berkeley difficult?\n\nA: Yes. All colleges/universities are difficult and getting a degree anywhere takes a lot of work. However, Berkeley is notoriously \u201cfull of academic rigor\u201d for a reason. \n\n_________________________________________\n\nQ: How hard is it to get research opportunities?\n\nA: It depends on the department but generally it is pretty accessible if you talk with people. This is one of the massive benefits of being at Cal. It\u2019ll require effort to \u201cget in\u201d but once you\u2019re \u201cin\u201d it\u2019s hard to stop.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nQ: How\u2019s the social life?\n\nA: I\u2019d say it\u2019s good. Cal isn\u2019t a party school but people do throw parties, socials and other get togethers decently often. There\u2019s a niche for everybody here mostly.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nQ: Is it safe?\n\nA: Yes and no. It\u2019s not the suburbs but it\u2019s also not a huge city. Crime happens here\u2026 be aware and keep your head on a swivel especially at night. I\u2019d honestly try not to walk at night in certain areas alone even as a man. \n\nHowever it\u2019s absolutely not the crime mega center it sometimes gets painted to be. There\u2019s also BearWalk/Safe walk/student CSOs who work through UCPD that are able to walk you places as security.\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nQ: I got a D, F or C on my Spring semester report will I get rescinded?\n\nA: Perhaps yes\u2026 perhaps no. Call the admissions office and ask. Typically if you communicate, have a good reason and if it\u2019s only one grade\u2026 you\u2019re fine. If you don\u2019t communicate or it\u2019s extreme, you may be fine but they may be less merciful.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nQ: I got into ABCD other school, I like Berkeley but would be devastated to not go to ABCD other school.\n\nA: Go to that other school if you truly think you\u2019ll be happier there. Unless you have a really compelling reason to choose Berkeley over that other school. I\u2019d suggest getting advice from a trusted mentor in that case.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nQ: How\u2019s the weather?\n\nA: I like it. Others don\u2019t. It gets chilly and sometimes cold during the winter\u2026 rainy and foggy often (35-70ish Fahrenheit). During the summers it can get somewhat hot (60-100 Fahrenheit) typically with some chilly days. The extrema of both temperatures represent outlying days. All in all the weather is pretty moderate but is relative to your own experience.\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nQ: Is grade deflation real?\n\nA: It\u2019s not as common as people make it out to be but, yes. Depends heavily on the department and even class, professor and the given semester. Generally though yes, it does exist.\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\nQ: Is Berkeley racist?\n\nA: Berkeley is extremely diverse in many ways. \n\nIncidents of individual prejudice/racism however still have occurred on this campus before unfortunately. \n\nThese incidents do not define the overall climate of Berkeley though. Generally, Berkeley is a safe and inclusive campus in an extremely diverse region of the world.\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nQ: How long will it take me to do (XYZ)\n\nA: It probably depends on many factors both individual and general. For the best guideline/knowledge I\u2019d say you should consult your specific department/department of interest web page. Moreover, the general Berkeley website has a lot of information too. Most departments have information on double majoring, concurrent majors and so forth.\n\nIf you want information on things like study abroad, ROTC, participating in certain things which sometimes require extra time/work like theatrical shows\u2026 etc\u2026 then there is typically a unique Berkeley website with pertinent information.\n\nTypically, there are advisors available for everything. In more \u201cuncommon\u201d cases it may be worth asking around as well or posting something once you have a decent idea of what you\u2019re thinking of doing.\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\nQ: Does the prestige of XYZ school VS Berkeley or Berkeley VS XYZ school matter?\n\nA: Yes and no. Prestige is relative. If you are planning on going into academia then yes, generally, it does matter. If you aren\u2019t going into academia/grad school etc.. prestige and renown will still open doors for you and is generally better to have if it\u2019s an option. But is not as important to consider. \n\nIn my opinion prestige shouldn\u2019t be a primary motivator when choosing a school. It absolutely can calculate into your choice though. \n\nIf you are really attracted to the prestige of Cal or another school, i\u2019d say asking yourself \u201cwhy\u201d is a good exercise. Is it the history? Faculty? Alumni? Or something else.\n\nAlso yes, Berkeley is generally perceived and backed up statistically as being prestigious. However there\u2019s so much more to Cal and life in general than prestige honestly.\n_________________________________________\n\n\n***** All in all don\u2019t let external opinion fully guide your choice. Go to the school which will provide you with the best opportunities, development and health (mentally, physically and spiritually). \n\nThere are many\u2026 many rumors, over exaggerated points and so forth surrounding Cal. Realize that while (some) of these are partly true, often they are blown out of proportion. ********\n\nAlso don\u2019t be afraid to ask. This is a general FAQ but if your answer is not here or posted elsewhere already\u2026 ask and get clarification.\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYou can always apply to Berkeley for grad school if you choose to go somewhere else but still want Berkeley, vice versa. You could even come here for a certificate, research or academic exchange\u2026 also vice versa.\n\nUltimately, the choice is yours. Maybe seeing these common Q & A points in one post will help. Maybe it\u2019s just a reiteration of what you\u2019ve already heard. \n\nRegardless, you got this!\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nGo bears! (And so forth)\n\nHave a great or better day\n\n\nP.s. - These are just points from my personal\nobservations and experiences. Others may have different input.",

      "title": "For those considering Berkeley",
      "content": "\nHey everyone,\n\n\nCongratulations!!! Berkeley is an amazing school that offers a lot of opportunities, freedom, and chance of self development and discovery. That being said, I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of questions about the life, culture, and academic pressure so I thought I\u2019d make a general guide you can refer to if you decide Berkeley is the place for you. \n\nIm making this because I wish someone had made something like this for me when I was your stage! \n\nI\u2019m not going to talk to much about the academic prestige because literally we\u2019re ranked top 5 in almost every program, so it\u2019s kinda wtv, but here are the things you want to consider!!!\n\n\n\nI hope this helped! \n\nGeneral:\n\nFirst, Berkeley is a pull yourself by the bootstraps kind of school. There are so many opportunities to make friends, explore the culture, and engage with the people ONLY if you make the effort. The unique thing about Berkeley is that it offers you tenfold in opportunities and the uniqueness of said opportunities when you decide to put yourself out there.\n\n\n\nCommunity: \nFurthermore, Berkeley is a really big school! There are so many organizations, vibrancy, and cultures to engage with. As a freshman, it might seem daunting to see where you might end up, but trust me when I say this, everyone finds their community at Berkeley and it is the most rewarding thing ever. The clubs, organizations, frats, and social circles you will join in this big school will set you up for life if you commit to it. You get what you put in.  I\u2019ve met the most amazing people simply because I chose to engage and really try to connect myself to others  !\n\nAcademics:\n\nDO NOT TRUST WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT OUR ACADEMIC REPUTATION!!! Ever since Covid, Berkeley has had grade INFLATION (I\u2019ll put the link to the article below) . Some classes I\u2019ve had here were so easy I came in high and I got one of the highest scores. That being said if you\u2019re a humanities major, DO NOT STRESS ABOUT THE ACADEMIC GRIND. Genuinely it is very easy to manage if you can read and engage with the material. I spend 4 hours per week (most of it\u2019s in class) and manage to get As or A-.   For the stem people, do not worry either. The unique thing about Berkeley is that it\u2019s a kind of teach yourself place when it comes to stem, so that means you have to go to office hours, commit to studying with friends, and ( it pays off!!) as someone who has a lot of friends in stem, the stem people I know who studied together literally became best friends or roomates or more and dominated each class.\n\nCulture:\nIn my opinion, it is the most vibrant and engaged community across colleges. I attend practically every protest, if it isn\u2019t your vibe, don\u2019t worry too much, you can ignore it. \n\nThe clubs here are so engaged, you\u2019ll see many of them on campus lobbying for you to join their club. Clubs are kind of hard to get into that I will say that much. \n\nFrats are fun! Our frat culture isn\u2019t like other frat cultures because most frats here are chill, genuinely nice guys that are academic and kind. ( experince varies though). I never thought I would rush a frat ever, but the people I met during rush were so interesting , genuine, and passionate people I can imagine spending forever chillin with!\n\nALSO! Berkeley is a public school. If you are considering privates, let me just say that Berkeley offers so much diversity of people when attending. I\u2019ve met people from so many walks of life. From rich to poor, to local to international, to rural to urban, to old to young, you will engage with so so so many different types of people \u2014- something a private school can never offer you fully. As someone who got into really really really selective privates, I can tell you right now, the minute I considered the diversity aspect of meeting different people from different walks of life, that\u2019s when I knew that Berkeley was the school for me. (Also because my mom cried during cal day when the chancellor said \u201cparents, your sacrifices of intense labor and worrying have paid off )\n\nOpportunities:\nCome on, it\u2019s Berkeley. The most life changing opportunities came from me just reaching out to the most randomness of places. My friend received an offer from a top tier company as a freshman because he was (eecs) ALSO ITS HELPS TO BE KIND! I think me for me being kind and friendly also helped! \n\nSafety:\nIm a man so it\u2019s different for me I think, but the homeless population here doesn\u2019t care and will leave you alone if you don\u2019t bother them. I walk alone at midnight and not once have I had a sketchy experience. The UC police is active and will help you sort out any problems you have \n\nHousing:\nDon\u2019t worry your first year. But onwards, while it might seem scary trying to find housing, it\u2019s actually kind of fun! You get to find roomates, locations, etc. again, this is one of the greatest things about Berkeley. You are presented with problems and you solve them with community or through ingenuity and trust me once you figure it out (and you will) it\u2019s so rewarding.\n\nHow do you know Berkeley is the place for you? If you are the type of person to put yourself out there, trust there\u2019s a community here waiting for you at Berkeley. If you have a passion Berkeley is the place for you.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID! I\u2019m not going to glaze Berkeley too much, how do you know if Berkeley isn\u2019t the place for you? If you aren\u2019t too engaged with what you do, and you are a lone wolf with a closed mind. Literally, if you have an open mind Berkeley will suit you just fine. \n\nGenuinely, I hope you pick Berkeley. The culture, history, and place in academics is unbeatable especially on the west coast. \n\nBe kind to yourselves and others!!! You made it to the other side! \n\n\n",

      "content": "**A Scholarly Analysis of Premium Defecation Localities at UC Berkeley: A Comprehensive Guide**\n\nFellow Bears,\n\nAs a UC Berkeley Public Health alumnus and current medical student, I feel compelled to share my doctoral dissertation on the most distinguished venues for answering nature's most pressing calls on campus. This isn't merely about finding a porcelain throne \u2013 it's about the holistic convergence of gastrointestinal wellness, architectural aesthetics, and mindful meditation.\n\nThrough years of rigorous field research and peer-reviewed personal experiences, I've developed a sophisticated framework for evaluating these sacred spaces. My methodology considers crucial variables such as ambient lighting, acoustic privacy (essential for those morning coffee aftermath scenarios), and the elusive 'zen factor' that transforms a mere bathroom break into a transcendent experience.\n\nAs any seasoned public health professional knows, the choice of one's daily constitutional venue can significantly impact both physiological and psychological well-being. The right environment can turn a mundane biological necessity into a moment of scholarly reflection or pre-exam meditation.\n\nLet me share my evidence-based findings...ranked accordingly to the evidence-based, aforementioned framework.\n\n**(1) Pimentel Hall** **(1/10) - A Case Study in Architectural Antipathy**\n\nLocation: Basement Level, Lower Sproul Plaza \n\nNamed after: Distinguished chemist George C. Pimentel \n\nYear Built: 1963\n\nAh, Pimentel Hall \u2013 or \"The Pits\" as it's affectionately known by generations of traumatized OChem students. While this brutalist monument to scientific achievement houses one of Berkeley's largest lecture halls and has witnessed countless Nobel laureates' lectures, its bathroom facilities seem to have been designed by someone who clearly had a vendetta against basic human comfort.\n\nThe bathroom in question, accessible via a suspiciously dim stairwell that would make Edgar Allan Poe uncomfortable, resides in what can only be described as the building's forgotten catacombs. The facilities appear to have last been updated when Lyndon B. Johnson was president, offering visitors a authentic historical experience of mid-60s plumbing technology.\n\nNotable Features:\n\n* Temperature regulation that alternates between \"Viking Winter\" and \"Sahara Afternoon\"\n* Acoustic properties that turn every flush into a building-wide announcement\n* Vintage graffiti featuring OChem reaction mechanisms from desperate students\n* A persistent mysterious drip that has outlasted several department chairs\n\nWhile the building itself has hosted groundbreaking discoveries in spectroscopy and molecular dynamics, the bathroom appears to be conducting its own long-term experiment in human endurance. The only redeeming quality is that the perpetual sense of despair perfectly matches one's mood after a particularly brutal chemistry midterm.\n\nPro tip: Best visited during Nobel Laureate lectures when the entire student body is trapped upstairs pretending to understand quantum mechanics.\n\nSustainability Rating: 1/10 - The only sustainable thing here is the sustained feeling of regret.\n\n**(2) Valley Life Science Building (VLSB) (2/10) - Where Dreams of Med School Go to Die**\n\nLocation: Valley Life Sciences Building, \n\nLower Campus Built: 1930 \n\nPrimary Clientele: Hopeful pre-meds, before organic chemistry crushes their souls\n\nAh, VLSB \u2013 where the T-Rex skeleton in the lobby serves as a haunting reminder that some things are better left extinct, much like these bathrooms. While the building itself stands as a testament to scientific achievement, housing everything from preserved specimens to cutting-edge research facilities, its bathrooms appear to have been designed by the set decorator of \"Children of Men\" during a particularly nihilistic phase.\n\nThe stark contrast is almost poetic: above, you have the prestigious Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory gazing down upon VLSB like a disappointed parent, while below, these bathrooms offer an experience that makes the dystopian facilities in \"District 13\" look like the Ritz-Carlton. The ambiance perfectly captures that moment in \"Blade Runner 2049\" when K descends into the ruins of Las Vegas \u2013 except instead of irradiated orange hues, you're treated to flickering fluorescent lights and mysterious drips that would make even a microbiologist nervous.\n\nNotable Features:\n\n* A peculiar aroma that has likely evolved into a new life form\n* Lighting fixtures that flicker in Morse code, spelling out \"abandon hope\"\n* Mysterious stains that could be the subject of several PhD dissertations\n* Acoustic properties that make every sound echo like you're in the \"Inception\" dream levels\n\nThe true irony lies in the fact that while students upstairs study the miracle of life and evolution, the bathrooms seem stuck in a parallel universe where sanitation never made it past the Mesozoic era. The proximity to the dinosaur exhibits feels less like an educational display and more like a warning about the state of the facilities.\n\nPro tip: Like the protagonists in \"The Maze Runner,\" your best strategy is to run \u2013 preferably to literally any other building on campus.\n\nScientific Value: 9/10 \n\nActual Usability: 2/10 \n\nEvolutionary Progress: -3/10\n\nWarning: Exposure may result in a sudden understanding of why those dinosaurs went extinct.\n\n**(3) Wheeler Hall** **(3/10) - A Neoclassical Nightmare**\n\nLocation: Central Campus, adjacent to hallowed ground where dreams of Stanford acceptance letters go to die \n\nArchitectural Style: Classical Revival (1917) \n\nNamed after: Benjamin Ide Wheeler, who clearly never used these facilities\n\nAh, Wheeler Hall \u2013 that magnificent testament to Berkeley's architectural ambitions, where the ghosts of rejected English dissertations roam the corridors and freshmen practice pronouncing 'Foucault' incorrectly. While its marble-clad exterior whispers sweet nothings of academic prestige, the bathrooms tell a different, more pungent tale.\n\nThe facilities present a stunning dichotomy: pristine white tiles that appear to have been designed by someone whose only brief was \"make it feel like walking into a supernova.\" The blinding luminescence serves the dual purpose of highlighting every questionable stain while simultaneously searing one's retinas \u2013 perhaps a metaphor for the illuminating yet painful process of academic enlightenment.\n\nNotable Features:\n\n* Lighting bright enough to be visible from the International Space Station\n* An acoustic design that turns every flush into a dramatic reading of \"The Waste Land\"\n* A persistent medieval bestiary of insects that would make an entomologist weep\n* That one particular stall on the 2nd floor, now famous for its resident arachnid who's probably earned tenure by now\n\nThe perpetual sewer bouquet provides a humbling reminder that beneath our sophisticated veneer of literary theory and cultural criticism, we are all still mere mortals. The spider's web above the large stall serves as both a security system and a poignant reminder of the web of interconnected narratives we study in comparative literature.\n\nPro tip: Best visited between Victorian Literature seminars, when one can truly appreciate the Gothic horror of it all.\n\nHistorical Significance: 8/10 \n\nActual Functionality: 2/10 \n\nSpider Companionship: 10/10\n\nWarning: The blinding white interior may cause temporary existential crises and spontaneous recitations of T.S. Eliot.\n\n**(4) Evans Hall** **(4/10) - The Concrete Confessional**\n\nLocation: Northeast campus, looming ominously like a bureaucrat's fever dream \n\nBuilt: 1971 Architectural Style: Brutalist (emphasis on 'brutal') \n\nPrimary Inhabitants: Data Scientists pretending they're not just CS majors who couldn't get into CS61A\n\nAh, Evans Hall \u2013 Berkeley's beloved tribute to East German prison architecture. This towering concrete monstrosity stands as a testament to what happens when architects decide that windows are merely a bourgeois construct. While Stanford's computer science department enjoys their Silicon Valley-inspired glass palaces, Berkeley's data scientists toil away in what appears to be a building designed by someone who mistook \"1984\" for an architectural handbook.\n\nThe bathrooms, however, exist in a peculiar state of quantum mediocrity \u2013 neither notably horrific nor particularly praiseworthy. Like a C+ grade in CS61A, they're just... there. In a building where students contemplate the existential dread of linear algebra and probability theory, these facilities offer a surprisingly neutral refuge from the windowless rooms where dreams of tech internships go to die.\n\nNotable Features:\n\n* Water pressure that follows a perfect normal distribution\n* Toilet paper holders that could be used as examples in STATS 101\n* A view of absolutely nothing, maintaining the building's commitment to sensory deprivation\n* Hand dryers that sound like they're computing Bitcoin on the side\n\nThe true irony lies in the fact that while students upstairs crunch numbers to predict the future, the bathrooms remain stuck in a perpetual 1970s time loop. Perhaps this is what the \"mid\" in EECS stands for.\n\nPro tip: Best visited during the golden hour when the concrete walls cast shadows that make you question whether you're in a bathroom or a modern art installation about institutional conformity.\n\nStructural Integrity: \u03c0/10 \n\nSoviet Nostalgia Factor: 9/10 \n\nData Science Street Cred: sudo/10\n\nWarning: Extended exposure may result in developing an unhealthy appreciation for concrete and a compulsive need to analyze the statistical distribution of toilet paper usage.\n\n**(5) Latimer Hall** **(5/10) - The McDonald's Drive-Thru of Campus Relief**\n\nLocation: Chemistry Complex, where dreams of medical school meet reality \n\nBuilt: 1963 \n\nNamed after: Wendell Mitchell Latimer, who probably had a private bathroom\n\nAh, Latimer Hall \u2013 the express lane of campus bathrooms, where efficiency meets minimalism in a space roughly the size of a reaction vessel. Like the chemistry department's version of a New York City micro-apartment, these facilities embody the principle that size doesn't matter (a lie we tell undergrads about their OChem reaction yields).\n\nThis bathroom facility, much like a fast-food value meal, provides exactly what you'd expect: nothing more, nothing less. It's the bathroom equivalent of \"good enough\" \u2013 much like that lab report you submitted at 11:59 PM. The space management here is so efficient it would make Marie Kondo proud, though it's unclear if anything here sparks joy.\n\nNotable Features:\n\n* A footprint smaller than a grad student's stipend\n* Acoustics that broadcast your presence to every passing GSI\n* A sink positioned with the precision of a titration experiment\n* That distinct smell of desperation and hydrocarbons\n\nThe true charm lies in its role as the preferred alternative to Pimentel's basement horror show \u2013 much like how students prefer literally any other career path after their first semester of OChem. It's the bathroom equivalent of settling for your safety school: not your first choice, but hey, at least you got in.\n\nPro tip: Best utilized between the hours of 2:15-2:45 PM when most GSIs are busy crushing undergrads' hopes in office hours.\n\nEfficiency Rating: 8/10 Size-to-Usage Ratio: 3/10 GSI Encounter Probability: 0.457 \u00b1 0.023\n\nWarning: May encounter bitter graduate students muttering about failed columns and rejected manuscripts. Avoid eye contact and back away slowly while showing your lab notebook as a sign of submission.\n\n**(6) Dormitory Bathrooms  -- The Great Residential Divide: A Tale of Two Bathrooms**\n\n**Blackwell Hall (8/10) - The Bourgeois Paradise**  \nLocation: Wherever the sun actually shines in Berkeley  \nBuilt: 2018, when someone finally remembered students need housing\n\nBehold, Blackwell Hall \u2013 Berkeley's monument to social stratification, where the chosen ones reside in their gleaming tower of modern amenities. The bathrooms here aren't just facilities; they're spa-like sanctuaries where privileged students can contemplate their good fortune while sitting on porcelain thrones that probably cost more than a semester's worth of textbooks. The water pressure is so perfect, it makes even Stanford students jealous.\n\nNotable Features:\n\n* Motion-sensor everything, because touching things is for peasants\n* Lighting that makes everyone look Instagram-ready\n* Actually functional ventilation (revolutionary concept)\n* Mirrors that don't make you question your life choices\n\n**Unit 3 (2/10) - The Proletariat's Purgatory**  \nLocation: The shadowy realm where hope goes to die  \nBuilt: Sometime between the Gold Rush and the Summer of Love\n\nAh, Unit 3 \u2013 the living testament to Berkeley's commitment to \"character building.\" Where the bathroom becomes a thrilling game of \"Guess What That Smell Is\" and \"Why Is The Floor Always Wet?\" The gender-inclusive facilities would be progressive if they weren't also inclusive to various forms of fungi and bacterial colonies conducting their own independent research projects.\n\nNotable Features:\n\n* Shower drains that double as unauthorized toilets\n* A mysterious symphony of 3 AM sounds that would intrigue paranormal investigators\n* Water pressure that alternates between \"gentle mist\" and \"fire hose\"\n* An ecosystem diverse enough to qualify as a biology field study site\n\nThe Nocturnal Experience:\n\n* 2:00 AM: Mysterious sobbing (probably OChem related)\n* 2:30 AM: Someone practicing their kazoo\n* 3:00 AM: The ghost of failed midterms past\n* 4:00 AM: That one person who decides to take a shower while practicing opera\n\nReal-life survival tips:\n\n* Always wear shower shoes (consider hazmat boots)\n* Don't ask about the strange noises\n* Pray for seismic activity to end your suffering\n* Remember: what doesn't kill you makes you more qualified for grad school\n\nWealth Gap Rating: Wider than the Berkeley Hills  \nCultural Experience: Marx would write a sequel  \nEarthquake Preparedness: Please, just one small tremor\n\nWarning: Extended exposure to Unit 3 facilities may result in developing a superhuman immune system or a deep understanding of class warfare \u2013 possibly both.\n\n**(7) The Libraries' Hidden Chambers (6/10) - Where Knowledge Meets Nature's Call**\n\nLocation: Scattered throughout campus like ancient wisdom  \nFocus: Moffitt Library & Free Speech Movement Caf\u00e9 Area  \nPrimary Clientele: Sleep-deprived students and coffee-fueled academic hermits\n\nAh, the library bathrooms \u2013 where intellectual discourse meets intestinal discourse. These sacred chambers, particularly those near FSM Caf\u00e9, offer a uniquely Berkeley experience: the chance to simultaneously relieve yourself while overhearing the complete psychological breakdown of a CS major or the passionate whispered rant of a political science student questioning capitalism.\n\n**The Moffitt Experience**  \nPicture this: You're seeking refuge in these tiled confessionals, when suddenly you become an unwitting therapist to the adjacent stall's occupant, who's softly crying about their Medieval Studies midterm while simultaneously ordering their third cold brew of the day. It's group therapy, but with dividers.\n\nNotable Features:\n\n* Exceptional acoustic properties for eavesdropping on academic crises\n* Toilet paper that's somehow simultaneously single-ply yet pretentious\n* The persistent aroma of FSM's coffee mixed with eau de anxiety\n* Graffiti that ranges from quantum physics equations to existential poetry\n\nPerfect for:\n\n* Introverts seeking the parasocial comfort of others' academic despair\n* Students needing material for their psychology papers\n* Anyone wanting to hear unfiltered opinions about professors\n* Those seeking the authentic college experience of crying in a bathroom\n\nPro tip: Peak drama hours occur during midterms and finals, when the bathrooms transform into confessionals for academic sins.\n\nPrivacy Rating: 4/10 (walls have ears)  \nEntertainment Value: 8/10  \nTherapeutic Potential: 7/10  \nCoffee Proximity: 9/10\n\nWarning: May accidentally become involved in someone's emotional breakthrough or spontaneous study group formation. Side effects include developing a pavlovian response to the sound of coffee grinders.\n\n**(8) Stanley Hall** (8.5/10) - The Enlightened Throne\n\nLocation: Northwest campus, where bioengineering dreams take flight \n\nBuilt: 2007 \n\nPrimary Clientele: Distinguished professors who've forgotten where they parked their Teslas and grad students pretending they belong\n\nAh, Stanley Hall \u2013 the gleaming jewel in Berkeley's STEM crown, where the bathrooms are as pristine as the building's grant funding. While lesser facilities across campus struggle with basic functionality, Stanley's restrooms achieve a zen-like state of perfection that makes one question if they're still on a public university campus at all.\n\nPerched majestically on the slope leading to the hallowed grounds of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Stanley Hall's facilities offer what can only be described as a spa-like experience for the academically enlightened. Here, one can contemplate the mysteries of protein folding or rehearse their Nobel acceptance speech in blessed solitude.\n\nNotable Features:\n\n* Pristine cleanliness that would impress a clean room technician\n* Lighting that actually flatters instead of fluorescent-flickering your soul into submission\n* Acoustic properties perfect for practicing your \"I just got published in Nature\" victory speech\n* Water pressure consistent enough to be worthy of a PhD thesis\n\nThe true luxury lies in the silence. No mysterious pipes groaning like a failed experiment, no echoing sounds of academic despair \u2013 just the peaceful serenity of a bathroom that actually believes in your research potential.\n\nPro tip: Best visited during faculty meetings when the building's inhabitants are elsewhere debating the future of science\n\nCleanliness Rating: NIH funding/10 Meditation Potential: 9.5/10 Impostor Syndrome Reduction: 7/10\n\nWarning: Extended use may make returning to lesser campus facilities emotionally challenging. May also result in unrealistic expectations for all future bathroom experiences.\n\n**(9) Dwinelle Hall (9/10) - The Labyrinth's Hidden Oasis**\n\nLocation: Somewhere in the space-time continuum of Central Campus  \nArchitectural Style: M.C. Escher meets Kafka  \nBuilt: In multiple dimensions simultaneously\n\nBehold, the greatest plot twist in Berkeley's bathroom saga \u2013 Dwinelle Hall, where students enter seeking classrooms and exit questioning reality itself, somehow houses the campus's most surprisingly sublime sanctuaries. Like finding a five-star spa inside a quantum physics experiment, these facilities defy all expectations and possibly several laws of nature.\n\nYou'd think a building infamous for its non-Euclidean geometry and ability to make seniors cry would host bathrooms that match its chaotic energy. And yet, like a secret garden in a concrete maze, Dwinelle's restrooms stand as monuments to civil engineering done right.\n\nNotable Features:\n\n* Sensor-equipped sinks that dispense actually warm water (a miracle by UC standards)\n* Pristine cleanliness that suggests a portal to an alternate dimension\n* Gender-inclusive facilities that welcome all who've managed to find them\n* A peaceful atmosphere that makes you forget you're in Berkeley's architectural fever dream\n\nThe true irony lies in the journey: while students spend hours lost in Dwinelle's twisted corridors trying to find their Comparative Literature seminar, those who stumble upon these bathrooms find themselves reluctant to leave. It's as if the building's chaos exists purely to protect these sacred spaces.\n\nPro tip: The challenge isn't finding a clean bathroom in Dwinelle \u2013 it's finding your way back to it once you've discovered it. Some say there's a bathroom so perfect it appears only to those who've given up hope of ever finding their classroom.\n\nNavigation Difficulty: \u221a-1/10  \nActual Facility Quality: 9/10  \nSpiritual Enlightenment: 10/10  \nProbability of Finding It Again: 3.14159/10\n\nWarning: May result in developing Stockholm Syndrome with a building. Some visitors report emerging from Dwinelle bathrooms to find themselves in different academic years or parallel universes where their classes were actually scheduled in Evans Hall.\n\n\n\n**CONCLUSION:** Fellow Bears, as we conclude this comprehensive analysis of Berkeley's finest (and most horrifying) facilities, let us remember the ancient medical wisdom passed down through generations of doctors: *\"The bowels are the window to the soul, but a clean bathroom is the door to sanity.\"* \\- Hippocrates (probably)\n\nAs both a medical student and a Berkeley survivor, I can confidently say that the quality of one's daily constitutional directly correlates with academic performance. Just as every great physician must know their anatomy, every wise Berkeley student must know their bathroom geography.\n\nFrom the blinding white abyss of Wheeler to the post-apocalyptic landscape of VLSB, from the proletariat porcelain of Unit 3 to the bourgeois brilliance of Blackwell, each facility tells a story. But perhaps the greatest lesson lies in Dwinelle Hall, where against all odds and architectural logic, paradise exists within chaos. It stands as a testament to that old medical school adage: *\"The best bathroom is not the closest one, but the one worth walking to.\"*\n\nRemember, dear colleagues, in the words of my attending physician: *\"Just as we must be selective with our diagnoses, we must be selective with our digestive sanctuaries.\"* Choose wisely, for your GPA \u2013 and your gut \u2013 may depend on it.\n\nFinal Rankings and Diagnoses:\n\n* Terminal Case: Pimentel Hall (2/10)\n* Chronic Condition: VLSB (2/10)\n* Stable but Guarded: Wheeler Hall (3/10)\n* Showing Signs of Life: Evans Hall (4/10)\n* Ready for Discharge: Latimer Hall (5/10)\n* Fully Recovered: Stanley Hall (8.5/10)\n* Miracle of Modern Medicine: Dwinelle Hall (9/10)\n\nPrescriptive Advice: When in doubt, hold it and hike to Stanley or Dwinelle. Your future self will thank you for the exercise and the excellence.\n\n*\"First, do no harm to your bathroom standards\"* \\- The Hippocratic Oath of Berkeley Bathrooms, 2024",

Clearly he's crazy and I don't want to get into a fight so I say my bad bro, take a step back, and start walking slower.\n\nI'm just walking down the street as usual and happen to be behind him. I'm even on my phone (while staying alert) so I'm not eying him down or anything. I would cross the street but this is the half of Hearst that had a divider down the middle. So I just wait a bit and start walking again.\n\n30 seconds later I see him walk on the left side of the narrow sidewalk and almost bump into a guy walking the other way who had to dodge him. A minute later he turns around again, now I'm at least 30 feet behind him but he yells into his phone \"this b\\*\\*ch is following me do I need to beat his a\\*s?\" I just say \"not following you man\", stop again, and let him keep walking. Again I would cross the street and take an alternate route but Hearst is still divided in two. This time I'm at least 100 feet behind him and he keeps turning around but doesn't say anything.\n\nLater I was in the Wozniak lounge and he opened the door, saw me, then left. He's probably not a student based on his behavior so idk how he got in. I also left then later saw him walking around the hallways of the Soda 3rd floor.\n\nHe's a black guy wearing a grey hood, black jacket with a brown shirt underneath, and grey pants, about 5'9\".

      "title": "UC Berkeley or Emerson College?",
      "content": "I am at a crossroads and would love to hear some opinions; I can\u2019t decide between Emerson journalism and UC Berkeley art history. \n\nI transferred into Emerson out of CC have already gone for 1 year, but my family\u2019s financial situation changed and made it so I couldn\u2019t afford the rest ~year and a half of my education there. I applied as a transfer to a few other institutions as a transfer again and got into UC Berkeley for my second-choice major of art history. I also got into SLC with a huge scholarship and Davis for practically free, amongst a few other schools, but Berkeley is still my top choice of the new pool of schools. \n\nI love journalism and have done a hell of a lot at Emerson (I run a co-curricular student org, I have 2 on campus jobs that I love, I do very well academically, started a band w some friends that\u2019s doing well locally). I\u2019d been pretty prepared to leave per the financial situation, but I was in a car crash that I got a huge payout for that could now comfortably pay for my last year and a half at Emerson with money still left in the bank. However, Berkeley is Berkeley, and I\u2019m a California resident so the tuition would be WAYYY cheaper than Emerson (even if I can pay for it now). \n\nI care a lot about my academics, and one of the few complaints I have about Emerson is the insanely low motivation amidst the student body. I don\u2019t know many students who strive for a lot there, and I feel like a lot of the student population is just kids with exorbitantly rich parents who are just kinda coasting because it\u2019s a pre-professional school. To that point, I also feel like there\u2019s an insane amount of immaturity at Emerson, it just feels like high school (I do a pretty good job at staying away from it but still). I also don\u2019t like that Emerson students are always at war with the faculty (and I hate how incompetent a lot of the upper-management of the school is). On admitted student tours, Emerson students will regularly interrupt and tell prospects not to come here. Even so, I still perform pretty highly there, and I feel good about what I\u2019ve done so far. \n\n\nAt Berkeley, I feel like I\u2019d be surrounded by likeminded people from incredibly diverse backgrounds, which I think is just a valuable thing when speaking to the worldliness of the student body. Plus, the educational opportunities are just insane regardless of the major, and I really admire that. There is also an incredibly tremendous and obvious benefit to the cheaper tuition and to the prestige of the school. I also understand that their STEM program is what they\u2019re known for, but their humanities are still very strong. I do worry about the Art History major as opposed to journalism; my goal for years has been to become and arts and culture critic/entertainment journalist post-grad, which I feel pretty confident about if I stayed at Emerson, and I worry about the post-grad job prospects at Berkeley. I also know I\u2019d have to get my masters for Art History if I wanted a job in that field, which I wouldn\u2019t mind because I\u2019d love to do curatorial, programmatic, or archival work, especially as it pertains to repertory cinemas\u2014and Berkeley has the BAMPFA which is just insane (and they\u2019re doing a Robert Altman retrospective right now\u2026 he\u2019s my favorite!!) But lots of those jobs are fewer and farther between. Also, every student I\u2019ve spoken to has said it\u2019s hard but rewarding to be at Cal and that they love it.\n\nAt Emerson, I feel like internships and jobs will come (and have come) pretty easily to me because I work so hard there, but I worry about internship opportunities (especially in art history) at Berkeley because everyone is such a high performing student. I know that many art historians go on to be writers, and Berkeley has a TON of alumni at major entertainment trades, but Emerson does too. I\u2019ve noticed that Berkeley and Emerson market themselves similarly (great student orgs, versatile education, study abroad opportunities, strong alumni network, having \u201cthe name\u201d) but the major differences come down to how the schools\u2019 respective student bodies engage with those opportunities. \n\nI really don\u2019t know and I have a couple of days to decide. I feel like I\u2019d be happy at either, but would also worry about leaving behind the other. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!!!!\n\n\n\nTLDR: I\u2019ve been at Emerson for journalism for a year and like it but thought I couldn\u2019t afford it going forward so I applied around as a transfer and got into Berkeley for Art History. They both have super strong alumni network and I\u2019ve built a super strong resum\u00e9 in journalism out of emerson (long term goal to be an entertainment writer) but I love the culture and educational opportunities at Berkeley. I worry about post-grad job prospects w Art History but Berkeley is a marginally more renowned school and I\u2019d pay in state tuition, but I think I\u2019d get a job much sooner out of Emerson",

      "title": "MCB 102 in-Depth Review (Spring 2024)",
      "content": "When I was preparing to take this course I wish I had a detailed review like this, so hope this helps...\n\nGeneral thoughts: I would be lying if I said this class is \"easy.\" It's definitely not a class you can not study for at all and get perfect scores in. You need to put in the work. But it's not impossible, and definitely not as horrible as some people make it out to be.\n\n  \nPart 1 (Professor Ahmet Yildiz):\n\nI went into the first section of the course thinking I'd need to memorize a bunch of amino acids, pKa's, etc.. There was not a lot of that. Yildiz is a professor who prefers application/conceptual understanding over brute force memorization. Take this with a grain of salt because the fall/other professors may have a different approach to the first section of 102. There is still quite a bit of info you need to memorize, but not to the extent people make it out to be.  \n\nHis lectures are fairly dry. He did not know how to keep track of time/pace himself very well so he would often go thru only half a slide deck and need to pick back up during the next lecture. Thankfully he stuck to his word and did not expect us to learn info he didn't get to. Important to note that he has a fairly thick accent and talks quite fast so it can be difficult to catch every word he is saying at times. Nonetheless, his slides were pretty clear. \n\nExam was difficult but honestly not as bad as Ochem exams were for me. There's a mix of mcq, true/false, short answer, calculations, etc... The calculation questions were the hardest imo. Keep in mind he's a biophysicist so you'll see some of his physics background show up in the lectures & the way he frames his calculation-based questions.  Regardless, the practice exam he gave from last year was definitely reflective of his exam. \n\nHe was the only professor to hold in-person office hours (helpful) and did stop for questions during lecture. Unfortunate part was that very little practice questions written by him were provided besides the practice exam. \n\nPart 2 (Professor Evan Miller):\n\nThis section was quite content heavy, but was honestly my favorite section of the course. I attribute that to Miller's teaching. Miller is just amazing at what he does. He's super clear, succinct, articulate, knowledgable, and easy to follow along. His lectures pack in quite a lot of info but it never felt like that because he would annotate on his iPad alongside us as he taught. He always finished his lectures on time and was never in a rush. It's pretty obvious he has been doing this for a long time. He incorporated a lot of learning strategies in his section (active discussion/share-outs during lecture, pre/post surveys to assess student understanding, activities during discussion section, etc...). \n\nMiller provided plenty of practice questions that were reflective/helpful for the exam. We received numerous problem sets, 2 practice exams, and practice questions built into the lecture. His exam was really long but because there was so many potential points - each question was not worth a whole lot (more room for mistakes). He was very upfront with his expectations and very helpful in office hours (held via Zoom).\n\nMiller's section did incorporate some Ochem mechanisms but there were only 2-3 mechanisms on the exam. His section requires a combination of pattern recognition, memorization, and application. Very little to no math. After doing a bunch of practice questions you really get a feel for the type of questions he likes to ask. \n\n  \nPart 3 (Professor Ross Wilson):\n\nPeople told me this section would be the easiest of the course. Not necessarily the case. \n\nProfessor Wilson is an extremely kind and easy-to-talk to/down-to-earth guy. He was always smiling, laughing, and making it easy to approach him. Nonetheless, his section's structure was not very helpful. Lectures were pre-recorded videos from 2020 that we were expected to watch on our own time. During the scheduled lecture time, Wilson would occasionally (on select days) show up to the lecture hall and do a Q&A / mini-review of the most recent lecture videos. Keep in mind these pre-recorded lectures were often an hour or longer. Wilson also stuttered/mumbled a lot. He would say something and then start questioning what he himself said or take something back. Or he would post a \"correction\" to something he said in the lecture videos. When people would ask questions during his in-person sessions, he would often get thrown off or not have a clear answer. I'm sure he's a smart guy but not necessarily the best teacher. \n\nWilson would provide really short assignments to complete (1-2 questions) but would then tell us that these questions were very hypothetical, not the best questions, too challenging, etc... Wilson constantly said he would not write such tricky questions on exams, but this wasn't necessarily the case. He was also constantly making comments about how he could have worded certain things better. \n\nHe was nice enough to provide ALL exams he's given while he's taught this course. He told us the most recent practice exam (2023) was going to be the most reflective, which was not 100% true because that exam was much much easier than ours and had questions straight up copy/pasted from previous years. Our exam was much harder than I expected it to be because the fill in the blank questions/MCQ's were each worth a lot of points. Getting one word or question wrong was quite costly. It was sometimes unclear what Wilson was asking for, or two answer choices seemed correct for the MCQ. It was kinda shocking because Wilson made it seem like his exam was going to be the easiest/ most straightforward when in reality it was quite challenging.\n\nContent-wise, Wilson packed a LOT into his lectures. It was hard to sense what was essential info and what was more supplemental/examples. The way he structured his lectures often felt out of order. The man did provide an \"elements to know\" list with essential terms/concepts however, which did help. \n\nI would argue part 3 was the hardest section of the course because of the structure/teaching style though Wilson is a hella chill guy. \n\nOverall thoughts:\n\nThis course definitely takes foundational concepts from Bio 1A and builds on it (with some added Ochem ideas/principles and a bit of math).If you liked Bio 1A you will probably enjoy the course content. The professors were pretty decent but had 3 different teaching styles/course formats so I could see people getting lost with expectations/deadlines/assignments if they didn't attend class in-person. It would have been nice if things were consistent across the three sections. \n\nOne issue I had with the course was the lack of transparency regarding course grading. It took many weeks for the first exam to be graded and then the regrade process was a little chaotic. The professors never brought up grade bins during class nor was there anything about grades in the syllabus. I never knew how I was doing or what grade I might get in the class. People kept telling me that to get an A you had to do approx 1.5 stdv above average, which definitely caused some anxiety. \n\nIf you have to take this class I'd recommend it in the spring. For the spring semester, you get a 4x6 cheatsheet notecard for every exam (not always useful but still better than nothing). Lecture recordings are always provided (which I heard isn't the case for all 3 sections in the fall). The professors ended up being very generous with the final grade bins for the course. We weren't provided with final cutoffs, but the head GSI suggested that approx 60 percent of the class got some form of A's or B's.  \n\nI was fortunate enough to do well in the course, so here is my advice for future students... 1) Don't skip lecture/ always attend in-person! I never missed a single one so keeping up with the material was not an issue. It's super easy to get behind in this class yet significantly difficult to get back on track once you slip up 2) Attend professor OH: I did this off and on but when I did go they were helpful. 3) Go to all review sessions - I attended GSI review sessions, professor review sessions, and the SLC ones - you have nothing to lose by going (more exposure to material the better). 4) Grind out ALL the practice exams/problems provided. They are 100% the best way to prepare for exams. 5) Take good notes and actually review them frequently. 6) Make Quizlet or Anki your best friend: I used flashcards to prep for every section and studied them on the daily. 7) Ask questions on ED or during discussion section: GSI's are very kind & willing to help. \n\nI used the textbook a little bit for part 1 (was somewhat helpful) and did not for parts 2 & 3. You don't need it, nor would I recommend going searching for Youtube videos. Lecture has everything you need. Oh, and there's no cumulative final! Midterm 3 (section 3 exam) happens during the allotted final exam time. Workload for the class is on the lighter side - just some problem sets that are graded on completion.\n\nAll in all, I actually enjoyed the course to some extent. It was definitely a rollercoaster of emotions / a challenging journey, but I think if you put in a lot of work/effort and remain positive - an A is not out of reach. This is not a Bio 1A/1B or Chem 1A where you can simply study the night before and still do amazing (all 3 exams had averages between 55 and 60 percent btw). But it's not at all the horrible class people scare you into thinking - it's likely easier than the physics series here and some upper div MCB courses. I wish people didn't make this class seem like it's straight out of a horror movie, but at the same time hearing people's experiences definitely pushed me to work harder.\n\n",

      "title": "Update: reviewing all the crispest water on campus",
      "content": "I will never let anything die! I am writing this as evidence of a realized hobby. Godspeed to anyone who reads any sentence of this.\n\n[here is the last post for context (?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u2csl0/crispest_water_on_campus/)\n\nArmed with the curated list of the recommendations of the last post, i put on my urban hiking (aka gentrified walking) playlist and I tried the crispest fountains of youth this campus cradles.\n\nMethodology:\n\nI condensed the list to only include potable water sources. I didn't try blackwell, because I don't know anyone who lives there and i am not trying to trespass. Further, I excluded the recommendation of the gym fountain, because I have an intensity about me that I fear would turn me into a gym bro if I set foot in a gym. I do not wish this fate upon myself so I am guarding my feeble sanctity by not crossing the gym line. Next, I opted for a non insulated metal water bottle so that leftover chill from previous water fountains could not influence the taste of the next water fountain in the case fountains were tried consecutively.\n\nAt this point we reach a Shakespearean impasse: to spit or to swallow, that is the question. Whether \u2018tis nobler to only taste the water fountain or to become bloated from all the water I consume in one day trying to hit up all the fountains. Normally when faced with this impasse, I gargle. You would be surprised how little liquid it takes to gargle. However, for the sake of science I chose to swallow all of the water I tasted.\n\nImportantly, fountains were tried on different days. Peer reviewers have pointed out this weakness in the methodology. However, a good fountain will consistently spit good crisp fluids into the crevices of a bottle even if there was no other water bottle filling action before the current fill, so the day of fill should not impact the crispness of water.\n\nScoring: **Anxiety (A)** was scored out of 2 (0 being please let the hot light of god shine upon me so that I may evaporate from this dreadful world and 2 being luxuriating in comfort). Anxiety noted the fearsome echo of the water bottle fill in comparison to a quite yet populated environment, general amount of people around (I don\u2019t like having more than one person looking at me at any given moment), and if any worrisome leaks surrounded the fountain.\n\n**Beauty (B)** was scored out of 3. Beauty includes any general aesthetics surrounding the fountain experience.\n\n**Crispness (C)** was the main scoring factor which is only fair given the list\u2019s method of curation. As is such, crispness was scored out of 10. Crispness includes freshness of taste and bone chilling temperatures. I wanted the water to transport me to Antarctica so vividly that I could remember if Antarctica was at the bottom or top of the globe.\n\n14. The opulent vlsb fountain: 4 = A: 1, B: 3, C: 0\n\nI could make tea with this tepid water.\n\n13. 4th floor of etch to the right when exiting the main elevator: 5 = A: 2, B: 1, C: 2\n\nThe only thing i can say is that thankfully with time this water will end up in the toilet where it belongs. Disliked! Blocked!\n\n12. Cory hall fountain near supernode: 7 = A:-1, B: 4, C: 4\n\nFear of eecs peoples societal superiority over a shivering social science girlie factored into anxiety. However, I confuse fear and admiration, so my type is eecs boys. The raw Chad eecs energy that made me scared of being hurt boosted the beauty ranking. These two biases balance out each other as a net neutral in the score. Controversially, I believe the water itself is actually overhyped.\n\n11. first floor physics north and 3rd floor at the end of the hall: 7 = A: 2, B: 1, C: 4\n\nYou could go through the trouble of measuring the temperature of this water in kelvin only to find it is room temperature\n\n10. asuc near amazon storefront: 7.1 = A: 1.8, B: 1, C: 4.3\n\ni had to deduct from the anxiety ranking since my shoes for crews non-slip new balances sounded like spongebob squeaky boots walking to the fountain. Though, it sure was water.\n\n9. 3rd floor of doe library by art history/classics: 7.3 = A: 2, B: 3, C: 2.3\n\nWith the amount of noise this fountain was making i expected water so cold even sigma freud would have penis envy of this spout. Yet i received nothing of the sort.\n\n8. Gianni hall: 8 = A: 2, B: 2, C: 4\n\nhell is colder than this water\n\n7. kroeber hall fountain, first floor: 8 = A: 2, B: 3, C: 3\n\npeople who use sensodyne toothpaste will enjoy the water of this fountain. I don\u2019t and did not enjoy this fountain. Though, I enjoyed the house posts.\n\n6. Evans ground floor: 10 = A: 0, B: 0, C: 10\n\nLovely as always, despite being in a building so bad even the university wants to tear it down.\n\n5. campbell hall 1st and 5th floor: 12.2 = A: 1, B: 2, C: 9.2\n\nThe fifth floor is marginally better than the first floor. The fifth floor is so fresh that I felt like an Alaskan salmon swimming upstream against all the tasks i should be doing. Unfortunately, the salmon imagery for which this water transported me made me afraid as we live on a campus full of bears. Bears fish salmon. For this reason, this is an anxiety inducing fountain\n\n4. stanley hall / the bottle filler next to yali\u2019s qualcam cafe: 12.8 = A: 2, B: 2, C: 8.8\n\nI shivered.\n\n3. Haas faculty: 13 = A: 2, B: 1, C:10\n\nThe sheer crispness of the water animorphed me into a polar bear. For this reason, I recommend this fountain for furries\n\n2. mcCone hall, 5th floor west side: 14 = A: 2, B: 3, C: 9\n\nright by a very beautiful patio view. I saw a berkeley squirrel (from afar) which coincidentally is the largest mammal i think i could confidently vanquish with my bare hands in a fight (now give me a sturdy stick and i could take on all the tigers at the Oakland zoo at once).\n\n1. Morrison music hall: 15 = A: 2, B: 3, C:10\n\nThe parade people who have drank from this fountain have worn a pale yellow oval into the tiles just in front of it. You can imagine them standing in the center of the worn out tile oval filling up their water bottle; and you can imagine all the people to come doing the same, making the oval a little paler. You can do all this imaging while you know that in the present you are filling up your bottle standing in that same oval. That worn out tile was the first time that I saw like the tralfamadorians. And so I thought, maybe I should read Slaughterhouse-Five again. That or maybe i should just touch grass and let this stupid hobby of reviewing waterfountains die. So it goes.\n\nUpdate of the update: they moved the elkay from the left to the right fountain in morrison hall. Therefore morrison hall water is no longer fire. This list remains in place but be cautioned that fountains may have changed.",

      "title": "International Christian Church and Shincheonji Activity at UC Berkeley",
      "content": "(Edited and updated. This is a very long post, but it has very important information regarding the International Christian Church-affiliated Disciples Reaching and Evangelizing All Mankind (DREAM) ministry and various Shincheonji-affiliated ministries and groups, such as NorCal Missions, that are active at UC Berkeley and other campuses across the Bay Area and nearby regions. I decided to only keep this post and delete to separate versions where I only talk about the International Christian Church activity at UC Berkeley in one post and about Shincheonji activity at UC Berkeley in the other post.) \n\nCurrently there is a campus ministry affiliated with the International Christian Church (ICC) (a cult that split off from the International Church of Christ (ICOC) and which has a chapter in the SF Bay Area known as the SF Bay International Christian Church (SFBICC)) called Disciples Reaching and Evangelizing All Mankind (DREAM) recruiting people at UC Berkeley and within the San Francisco Bay Area. The ICC also has other campus ministries at other colleges and universities, whether it goes by DREAM or by another name such as Soaring Eagles. They have been active at UC Berkeley for several years and are still active today. One way to identify DREAM or other ICC-affiliated campus ministries and groups is if the recruiters tell people they can't be Christian or be saved until they disciple anyone, give up certain things, follow and obey all the teachings of Jesus, and be baptized into the ICC. Also, ICC-affiliated ministries and groups like DREAM will have one-way Bible studies (members teaching things to recruits) and ICC members will take notes and give them to the recruits at the end of each Bible study lesson. The ICC is led by Kip McKean, and its Bible studies use a book by him called \"First Principles.\" ICC groups may call their Bible studies \"Bible talks.\"\n\nAnother cult that claims to be Christian, which is more secretive and initially less aggressive than the ICC, is Shincheonji (SCJ). Shincheonji has also been active at UC Berkeley for a few years and is still active at UC Berkeley, as well as at other colleges and universities within the San Francisco Bay Area and nearby areas. Shincheonji recruiters will not initially reveal the name of their campus ministry or group to anyone until they have progressed in the Bible studies with SCJ. SCJ recruiters will also not tell anyone what church or denomination they're affiliated with until one has completed all the lessons with SCJ. There are several ways to identify SCJ-affiliated groups:\n\n\\- The Bible studies begin with introductory lessons, followed by small class lessons (lasts about 6 to 9 months), followed by large class lessons (lasts about 1 year)\n\n\\- The Bible lessons mention about \"history, moral teaching/instruction, prophecy, fulfillment\"\n\n\\- In some of the later lessons (though I never got that far but I learned about it in my research on SCJ), teachers and leaders will usually tell students not to tell anyone outside the group about the lessons or about the group itself\n\n\\- The Bible lessons are heavy on parables and on the knowledge and understanding of parables, and teach that one must know and understand the parables to receive salvation, as well as teaching about \"the Language of Heaven\", meaning parables, and teach about secret knowledge\n\n\\- Bible lessons are in classroom format, with teachers and students. The teachers will occasionally use whiteboards or pieces of paper to write notes and draw pictures of what they're teaching. The Bible lessons will generally be in one direction only (teacher to student)\n\n\\- Notes are to be taken, but only through handwriting. Taking pictures of what's on the whiteboard or the piece of paper is forbidden. One also can only use a physical copy of the Bible\n\n\\- \"Hand clapping for God\" at the end of each Bible lesson is a custom everyone must do at the end of the closing prayer\n\n\\- Bible lessons talk heavily and frequently about spiritual harvests, spiritual food, fields, birds, vines, among other things\n\n\\- In later Bible lessons, there will be more weird unbiblical teachings, such as teachings about the \"Promised Pastor\" and about the \"New John.\" These two terms refer to the leader and founder of Shincheonji, Manhee Lee. Additionally, they will also teach later on when one goes further in the Bible studies that lying is okay under circumstances and take various Bible verses out of context to justify lying, despite the fact that the Bible clearly teaches that lying is a sin (I never got to this point when I studied the Bible with Shincheonji members, but this is based on my research on Shincheonji and its affiliated groups after I left NorCal Missions, which is the current name for one of SCJ's groups in the Bay Area and nearby regions)\n\n\\- The Bible study group teaches that one cannot be sure of their faith or that they were truly saved until they do everything Jesus tells people to do in Scripture, according to what the Bible study group teaches, in addition to knowing and understanding all the parables\n\n\\- Teachers and leaders don't let any student learn most Bible lessons individually nor do they explain certain lessons to students individually because they say the lessons can only be taught in the small class or the large class\n\n\\- Discussions and questions about the Bible or any theological concept are generally discouraged or even forbidden unless if the student agrees with what the teacher tells them. Otherwise, the teachers may accuse students of stirring up doubt or of wanting to argue or debate with them, or they might stop talking to those students\n\nAdditionally, SCJ-affiliated groups will occasionally change their names to avoid being exposed as being affiliated with SCJ or once those groups have been exposed as being affiliated with SCJ. Shincheonji in the Bay Area and nearby regions have a church or mission center called the San Francisco Zion Church. Within the Bay Area, SCJ groups are known as NorCal Missions and True Vine SF, and SCJ also runs a website called Bible Study For All. Other names that various SCJ-affiliated groups went by in the Bay Area and nearby regions include Ignite Ministry, True Vine Ministries, Religare, Global Light, Revive Sacramento, Zion Missionary, and Christians of NorCal. One other group in the Bay Area that I found out online that I suspect was another SCJ group is Revival SJSU.\n\nCurrently cults such as Shincheonji and the ICC are recruiting UC Berkeley students, alumni, faculty, and staff through Instagram and other social media platforms due to the COVID pandemic and restrictions and all other activities are online due to the pandemic and restrictions. They especially target Christians, and have been trying to recruit people from Intervarsity, Cru, Bridges International, the Newman Hall, and other campus ministries. In addition, these two cults, along with several other cults in the Bay Area and nearby areas, are also recruiting people who are neither students, alumni, faculty, nor staff of UC Berkeley within the Bay Area and nearby areas, in person and online. Shincheonji members in the United States are also recruiting people from other parts of the US and from other countries through Instagram, as I have observed.\n\nIf you are studying the Bible with an SCJ-affiliated group such as NorCal Missions or with an ICC-affiliated group such as DREAM, quickly leave that group and encourage anyone in an SCJ-affiliated group or an ICC-affiliated group including those you know to leave that group. Like DREAM and other ICC-affiliated Bible study groups, Shincheonji-affiliated groups such as NorCal Missions are not healthy Bible study groups for anyone, whether or not they're Christian, and they will not help Christians grow in their faith in God.\n\nManipulation, control of people's lives, sleep deprivation, gaslighting, deception, dishonesty such as lying, and unquestioned obedience to leaders are all present within the ICC and Shincheonji.",

It's easy to get distracted seeing all the \"cracked\" kids taking 20 units and feeling like you have to compete, but if you do so you might not reach your full potential, which is better done at your own pace -- and you know your own limits best. Some people actually understood this back in college, but I always let my ambition outstrip my own ability lmao.\n\nNow regarding life outcomes, I'm doing fine because I graduated a few years back when the job market was awesome.

      "title": "While most schools chase prestige in single disciplines, UC Berkeley cracked the code on undergraduate ROI by being consistently second-best at everything",
      "content": "What up Cal,\n\nI wrote a post for The College Sherpa about how we might be grossly underrated school. \n\nI'll post the entire article below so you don't have to click off, but I wanted to share it here because I was really excited writing it.\n\nHere's why I think y'all will like this story:\n\n* It's about Cal. It should probably just end there.\n* Cal is probably the best choice for \"most\" people\n* Cal has carved itself a pretty good niche in the world of college admissions\n\nIf you wanna check it out, here's the original post: [https://collegesherpa.beehiiv.com/p/the-biggest-scam-in-higher-education](https://collegesherpa.beehiiv.com/p/the-biggest-scam-in-higher-education)\n\n# Why This School Should Probably Be A Top 3 School\n\n**While most schools chase prestige in single disciplines, UC Berkeley cracked the code on undergraduate ROI by being consistently second-best at everything**\n\nI'm sitting in a Palo Alto coffee shop next to two parents having the kind of conversation that makes you eavesdrop shamelessly.\n\n\"Harvard rejected Emma, but she got into Berkeley engineering,\" says one. \"I'm honestly relieved.\"\n\nThe other parent nearly chokes on her oat milk latte. \"Relieved? It's Berkeley.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but think about it. She'll probably switch majors twice, graduate debt-free, and still end up at Google. Meanwhile, Sarah\u2019s kid is studying classics at Harvard for $320,000.\"\n\nThat overheard conversation captures something fascinating happening in elite education. While parents obsess over getting their kids into schools that dominate specific rankings, UC Berkeley has quietly perfected a different game entirely.\n\n**The portfolio theory of college admissions**\n\nHere's Berkeley's not-so-secret weapon: they're not #1 at anything major, but they're consistently top 3 at everything.\n\nComputer science? #3 behind MIT and Stanford. Business? #3 behind Wharton and Stanford. Engineering? #3 behind MIT and Stanford. Psychology? #2 behind Harvard. The pattern holds across virtually every undergraduate program.\n\nThis sounds like a participation trophy strategy until you realize most 18-year-olds have no clue what they actually want to study. According to the Department of Education, 80% of students change their major at least once, and the average student changes majors three times.\n\nAt Harvard, switching from their #1-ranked economics program to their middle-tier engineering program feels like academic exile. At Berkeley, switching majors means moving from one top-3 program to another top-3 program.\n\n\"It's portfolio diversification applied to education,\" explains Dr. Sarah Chen, who studies higher education economics at Stanford (ironically). \"Berkeley accidentally created the index fund of universities.\"\n\n**The innovation breeding ground effect**\n\nBut Berkeley's real genius isn't in the rankings\u2014it's in the collision effect.\n\nWhen you're #1 at computer science, you attract the world's best computer science minds. When you're top 3 at everything, you attract the best minds from every field, and they all end up in the same dining halls, study groups, and weekend parties.\n\n\"I met my co-founder in a philosophy class, my lead engineer in an art history seminar, and my first investor at a poetry reading,\" says Maria Rodriguez, whose Berkeley-founded startup was acquired by Apple for $400M. \"That doesn't happen at specialized schools.\"\n\nThe numbers back this up. Berkeley undergraduate alumni have founded more companies valued at $1B+ than any other public university. They've also won more Nobel Prizes, started more nonprofits, and held more Fortune 500 CEO positions than graduates from schools with higher overall rankings.\n\n**The stealth wealth angle**\n\nThen there's the economics that make wealthy parents pause their Ivy League obsession.\n\nBerkeley's in-state tuition runs about $15,000 annually. Out-of-state hits $48,000\u2014still cheaper than most privates. But here's where it gets interesting: savvy families have discovered loopholes that would make tax attorneys proud.\n\nSome establish California residency through \"digital nomad\" programs. Others use Berkeley's satellite programs. A few leverage obscure scholarship programs tied to specific counties or professions.\n\n\"I know parents who've bought $200,000 condos in Oakland just to get their kids in-state tuition,\" says one educational consultant who requested anonymity. \"Do the math\u2014they save $120,000 over four years and end up with Bay Area real estate.\"\n\nMeanwhile, their kids get the same professors, research opportunities, and alumni networks as students paying full freight at comparable private schools.\n\n**The prestige paradox**\n\nThe final twist? Berkeley's \"second place\" strategy is creating a different kind of prestige.\n\nWhile Harvard graduates network within narrow alumni circles, Berkeley graduates populate every industry at every level. They're the CEOs hiring Harvard MBAs, the VCs funding Harvard entrepreneurs, and the professors teaching Harvard students.\n\n\"Berkeley doesn't produce the most exclusive graduates,\" notes education researcher Dr. James Wilson. \"They produce the most connected ones.\"\n\nThis shows up in unexpected ways. Berkeley alumni are more likely to hire from diverse schools, more likely to promote based on merit over pedigree, and more likely to challenge conventional wisdom\u2014probably because they've been doing it since freshman year.\n\nThat coffee shop conversation I overheard? The relieved parent was onto something. Sometimes being second-best at everything beats being first-best at anything.\n\nEspecially when \"everything\" includes the ability to think differently about what winning actually means.",

My L&S Advisor said Chem 1A and 1AL will be difficult to get for first-years:( but idk if they\u2019re just discouraging me\u2026 they emphasized that Chem 1A is fast paced and assumes a foundation in chem. I took AP Chem soph year which was 2 years ago lol\n\nAlso I\u2019m a bit confused on Chem discussion. Do I schedule my chem discussion after I register in the class? I was already able to add it to my shopping cart without adding a discussion, but had to schedule a discussion time in order to add Math 51.\n\nPlease feel free to leave any academic and productivity advice for these two classes, I\u2019d love to hear it.

There were many students in line ahead of me so I never go to ask a question. However, when a previous student was stuck on a problem on the board, I helped them out and they understood the solution. Apparently Norman witnessed this and told me \"good work.\" This comment brought me immense happiness and empowered me to finish the course strong. Thanks Norman!!!!!",

      "content": "Good morning all,\n\nI will be transferring for the Fall semester for computer science. Frankly, I was initially excited, but was saddened because I turned down UC Davis (it's close to home), and now am anxious about it more than anything, with my mind telling me I should have picked Davis even with the downhill trajectory of its department. I wanted to ask if anyone's got some feedback on the department. I know it is a lot of work. As a background, I'm an older student who had always wanted to get into the field since I was younger, but because of life delayed a number of years, got medically retired from the military, deployed doing civilian contractor work, and went back to school for CS, not really intending to get to Berkeley but chose it knowing it had the better program and support. However, I really feel I'm over my head and am therefore struggling emotionally.\n\nI have several questions if anyone would like to share their experiences:\n\n1. Is driving from Vacaville realistic? I was thinking driving to El Cerrito Del Norte BART and then taking that rather than going straight into Berkeley. Alternatively, is parking usually available if I get the UC Berkeley parking permit?\n\n2. Is the coursework doable, at least initially? I did some assignments already to get my feet wet, but am not certain how intense the first semester will be at Berkeley.\n\n3. Is there grace for those who simply can't get up to speed with everything? Like, for myself, I have to take a lot of time understanding concepts. I will try to utilize office hours and take everything in, but really worry about falling behind.\n\nThank you all in advance for reading and your responses. I appreciate you all.",

I don't mind taking overnight buses/trains if that extends how far I can go, but I don't want to take Greyhound etc and I don't want to get a hotel. Some trips I've tried so far are:\n\n- Sacramento (80 mi, $29 each way): take Amtrak Capital Corridor in the morning, come back in the evening\n- Santa Cruz (75 mi, $19 each way): Bart to San Jose + 17 bus to Santa Cruz in the morning, head back in the evening\n- Santa Rosa (57 mi, $15-$20 each way): Bart or F bus to Salesforce Transit Center in the morning then take 101 bus to Santa Rosa, head back in the evening\n\nI've been looking at other places that are far yet transit-accessible like Point Reyes Station (44 mi, $12 each way), and I noticed that you can plausibly go as far as Lake Tahoe area and come back within the same day (179 mi, Amtrak to Truckee) but you can only spend like 2 hours there so it doesn't make sense. Same situation with Mendocino (157 mi), which somehow has a long-ass bus line from Santa Rosa, but you can only spend like an hour there since there's no evening bus.\n\nHas anyone taken such a trip? Any other ideas for destinations?",

I submitted a RTV but I honestly have no idea what the chances are it will be approved. It's still over 2 months until move in. I don't know if they just have to have someone apply who can take my space or if they have to fill the entire building first and THEN find someone who wants a spot. I am down with a cancelation fee but I have a terrible feeling I'm going to be stuck for an entire year if they have to fill the whole location (761 students) vs just any new app.\n\nHas anyone been granted a release of a grad student apartment at any point during their lease?

But I have two concerns - will the bus route be too long? I am thinking it's probably fine since it's free and I can read or catch up emails etc on the bus. But I will also have a car - needed for weekends etc and I am driving it from FL - how much will parking at the apartments cost (separate from costs to park near the law school.) It's only for a year but I am hoping there are grad students around? Some reddit posts make it sound like a ghost town. $1600 a month for laundry in the apartment and furnished and with a gym does not sound like the worst deal. Thoughts?

      "title": "As a PhD student: thoughts on my three options of where to live: West Berkeley, South Berkeley, North Oakland",
      "content": "I\u2019ll be starting a PhD at Berkeley soon, and I\u2019m choosing among three apartment options. I know that there are tradeoffs for all of these options, and ultimately only I can weigh them, but if people with experience as a PhD student and/or experience living off-campus in Berkeley can give their two cents, that could help a lot! To add some context, I\u2019m an avid cyclist so that\u2019s how I plan to get around. I value urban living (I know Berkeley is more  \u2018dense suburban\u2019 in much of the city) in that I like being decently close to at least a few cafes and restaurants. And a bar, ideally. It would be great to not have to share stuff with too many roommates \u2014 I currently live in a tight four-bed, and kitchen space has been a source of frustration (though not conflict) from time to time. I\u2019d also love to not have to share a bathroom with too many people. \n\nIt would also be helpful to know if these rents are reasonable for their locations. In the city I\u2019m coming from, I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at sniffing out when a place is overpriced. I\u2019m pretty okay with living a bit farther from campus to pay less\u2014again, I\u2019m an avid cyclist and I\u2019m pretty confident that I can get around easily that way. \n\n**Option 1:** I can pay $1145/month to live about 1.5 miles west of campus in a decently sized furnished room with a private bathroom and four roommates. But it\u2019s farther from cafes, restaurants and bars, as well as a mile from BART. I\u2019d also have to walk about a mile to get to any grocery store. \n\n**Option 2:** I can pay $1225/month to live about 1.8 miles from campus in a huge furnished room with two roommates, one bathroom, and no dishwasher. I\u2019d be 5 minutes from BART and walking distance to numerous bars, restaurants, and grocery stores. It\u2019s right by the Oakland border and close-ish to Temescal/Bushrod, so my guess is it isn\u2019t near tons of undergrads but idk. My pause is that I\u2019d be sharing the bathroom with two other people. \n\n**Option 3:** I can pay $1500/month to live about 2.3 miles in a studio in Temescal (Oakland). It would be unfurnished. It\u2019d be very close to a few grocery stores and about a 15 minute walk from BART. My pause is that this is significantly pricier than every other option, and the PhD stipend at Berkeley is very good as far as stipends go, but it\u2019s not high. I\u2019d be spending 38% of my pre-tax income on rent. ",

Frankly, I was initially excited, but was saddened because I turned down UC Davis (it's close to home), and now am anxious about it more than anything, with my mind telling me I should have picked Davis even with the downhill trajectory of its department. I wanted to ask if anyone's got some feedback on the department. I know it is a lot of work. As a background, I'm an older student who had always wanted to get into the field since I was younger, but because of life delayed a number of years, got medically retired from the military, deployed doing civilian contractor work, and went back to school for CS, not really intending to get to Berkeley but chose it knowing it had the better program and support. However, I really feel I'm over my head and am therefore struggling emotionally.\n\nI have several questions if anyone would like to share their experiences:\n\n1. Is driving from Vacaville realistic? I was thinking driving to El Cerrito Del Norte BART and then taking that rather than going straight into Berkeley. Alternatively, is parking usually available if I get the UC Berkeley parking permit?\n\n2. Is the coursework doable, at least initially? I did some assignments already to get my feet wet, but am not certain how intense the first semester will be at Berkeley.\n\n3. Is there grace for those who simply can't get up to speed with everything? Like, for myself, I have to take a lot of time understanding concepts. I will try to utilize office hours and take everything in, but really worry about falling behind.\n\nThank you all in advance for reading and your responses. I appreciate you all.",

On top of the millions of dollars in tuition paid directly to the city. No offense, but this school predates this fucking city. I don't understand why the fucking NIMBYs and hippies of the Berkeley Hills run around pretending like they hate to see college students in a college town.\n\nThis all started with the parking. THe fucking PARKING is ridiculous here. I truly believe that its the singular goal of the city government to make it a living fucking hell to be a student here. Tickets everywhere, restrictions all the time. I get it that the place would be insane if everyone had a car. On the other hand, the city actively squeezing students out of every single cent is bonkers to me.\n\nTruly, to my core, I think the city government can choke. I've spent the last 3 months in permit hell, and then to top it all off, the city has the audacity to give me three tickets when THEY won't process my permit.

It looks really nice and modern, but I\u2019m unsure if it\u2019s too far away. Is it normal for grad students to take transit every day?\n\nWould love to know: what\u2019s it like living in Berkeley as a grad student? Do people usually try to live close to campus or is commuting by bike or bus totally normal? Any advice for someone starting out in their first year?\n\nThanks in advance!\n",

Just wanted to share a story about something that happened today, so people can stay vigilant/be careful.\n\nAround 2:15 PM, I was walking alone on Frank Schlessinger Way. A little before I reached Campanile Way, I heard the sound of a bike decelerating behind me (the bike made that ticking noise when the rider stops pedaling). Turning around, I saw a guy who maybe looked homeless, holding a basketball under his arm, slowly trailing behind me on his bike. There was a lot of space to pass me and nobody was really around. I sped up my pace, kept walking and reached Campanile Way, an area where students were present (like 10-15 of them) and turned around. The guy stopped his bike and randomly started looking around, so I kept walking towards Dwinelle Hall / an area with more people. \n\nAfter some walking and a lot of looking behind me, I couldn't see the guy anymore. While I'm not sure if he was following me, his behavior was definitely strange and off-putting, especially being a skinnier female who obviously isn't athletic. \n\nHe was an African American man, maybe in his 30s or 40s, with a basketball. The guy had dreads, a little above shoulder length. I think he was wearing a black helmet and his bike was a metal gray color, on the darker side. \n\nPlease stay safe everyone!",

I was wondering if any Berkeley students, preferably also who are majoring in Civil Engineering (though I'd appreciate any and all advice), could give me some advice on what laptop to get for my major. My budget is about $1,500, but I'm open to spending much less or a bit more if it suits my needs.\n\nI want my laptop to at least last three years at Cal, and obviously wanting it to be with me throughout my entire time at this college, so I do want solid durability. Because of this, I was also interested in knowing if Cal students would recommend putting up the extra cash for 32 GB RAM and 1 TB of storage instead of the more standard 16 GB and 512 GB. I've heard that going above 16/512 is a bit overkill though from some sources, even for gaming, so I'm still open to either 16/512 and 32/1TB.\n\nI've also been unable to find online what exactly my laptop needs to do in Civil Engineering: I would assume it at least needs to run Revit or a similarly demanding 3D designing software, which is why I've also been looking for power. I'm also been looking to do some gaming on the side, as I don't plan on bringing my PC to college. I'm not a hardcore gamer though, so I'm open to decreasing settings on AAA games for more performance and less stress on my laptop.\n\nMy current top choice is an ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 2024 16GB RAM/1TB once it goes on sale later this month so I can buy it for about $1,000 while getting high-end performance and an overall premium laptop.\n\nSorry if I was confusing in this post, just looking for general advice on what I should be looking for as well as specific recommendations really.\n",

      "content": "[Original Reddit Post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1l9b0vk/starting_a_referral_resume_support_discord_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nUpdate (June 14 Evening):\n\nIt\u2019s been just **5 hours** since the google form went up, and we\u2019ve already started getting interest from alumni, and the response has been amazing so far. We\u2019ve got folks signing up from a wide range of industries including tech, consulting, automotive, real estate, finance, legal, AI, and aerospace.\n\nSome of the companies we have so far: **Anthropic, Apple, Astranis, NVIDIA, SpaceX, Salesforce, Accenture, Lyft, and ServiceNow, and many more**. Super excited about the mix of alumni coming in. If you\u2019re a Bear and want to help (or get help), this is really starting to come together\n\nBerkeley email verification system on Discord is now set up, and the Discord server has been officially created. We\u2019ll be slowly rolling out access to alumni next week as we assemble the initial team of job referrers and resume reviewers. Once that is in place, we\u2019ll open it up to students and new grads. Stay tuned! \n\n \\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nJust wanted to post a quick update because\u2026 wow. It seems like a lot of people are interested in this idea, and honestly, the response has been amazing. We\u2019ve officially gotten the green light to go ahead, and we\u2019re going to start rolling this out soon (Green light really just means a few of us (Cal Bears) agreed to spend our weekend working on this... we all have full-time jobs after all)...\n\n**First step: pulling together a  crew of alumni who are down to help with resume reviews and job referrals.**\n\nIf you're a Cal grad working in tech, consulting, finance, biotech, or **really anywhere**, and you remember how much the job hunt sucked... we\u2019d love to have you on board. No coaching experience needed. No weekly meetings. Just a hour or two a week to review resumes or submit internal job referrals can make a massive difference.\n\n# \ud83d\udc49Cal Alum Sign-Up Form (for those who can provide referrals): [https://forms.gle/PNfy9DKzUbQR5RLo6](https://forms.gle/PNfy9DKzUbQR5RLo6)\n\nShare it to any Cal Alum you know too!\n\nWhy You (Yes, You) Should Join This as an Alum:\n\n* You remember how soul-crushing the job hunt was. That endless loop of cold DMs, ignored applications and interviews, and awkward coffee chats that go nowhere?\n* **Worst case? You get laid off one day... and now you\u2019ve got this Discord at your back. Layoffs are brutal and random. But when it happens, you\u2019ll already be plugged into a network of Bears who\u2019ve got your back and give you referrals, ready to return the favor. You helped them, and they\u2019ll help you**\n* Someone probably helped you...  this is your chance to pay it forward\n* You can make a real difference in under few minutes a week... Skim a resume or Drop a referral on your lunch break or boring meetings. That\u2019s it\n* Referring or giving honest feedback to Berkeley students can change their entire career\n* You can stay totally anonymous if you want in the discord\n* You\u2019ll wish this existed when you were job hunting. This is what we all needed back then \u2014 and now we get to build it.\n* You\u2019ll never get a cold LinkedIn DM here. **No \u201cHi, hope you\u2019re doing well\u2026\u201d nonsense.** That energy is dead.\n* This isn\u2019t some corporate career group. No \u201clet\u2019s grab coffee\u201d energy\n* You don\u2019t need to \u201cmentor.\u201d You just need to be real. Say \u201cyour resume sucks and needs work\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t refer you yet\u201d ... that kind of honesty is more valuable than any coffee chat.\n* You were lost, stressed, and under-qualified once too. Don't forget what it felt like to need a hand and not know where to ask.\n* You don\u2019t have to be a  career coach, just be a human who remembers the grind.\n* No one's selling anything. It\u2019s literally just a bunch of Cal students and grads trying to make job hunting suck less\n* It\u2019s Berkeley-only (No randoms from the internet)\n* You\u2019re probably already scrolling Discord or Reddit during work anyway\n\nLet\u2019s be honest... we all know the Berkeley Career Center is barely helpful for most students and for you. You wait a week to meet with some random career advisor who\u2019s never worked in tech, finance, or literally any industry you're applying to. They give you a generic resume template and tell you to \u201cCheck Handshake\u201d or \u201cApply on LinkedIn.\u201d Career fairs? Half the time you're talking to an underpaid event rep who just hands you a flyer and free merch and says \u201cscan QR code and apply on our website.\u201d No follow-up. No Berkeley insider advice. This Discord is everything that\u2019s missing: actual feedback, real internal referrals, and brutally honest advice from people who got hired... not someone in Career Center who left the workforce 15 years ago.\n\n# -------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Still a student or new grad?\n\nIf you're currently job hunting or about to, and you want resume help + real job referrals (no cold LinkedIn DMs or awkward coffee chats), we'll email you when the Discord goes live. We're aiming to go live before the fall 2025 semester kicks off and ahead of the internship recruiting cycle\n\n# \ud83d\udc49Cal Student/New Grad Early Interest Form: [https://forms.gle/P1smd8FaH3DM97Zr6](https://forms.gle/P1smd8FaH3DM97Zr6)\n\n# \n\nThis is a 100% free, Berkeley-only space. No spam. No corporate vibes. Just Bears helping Bears, fast, honest, and low-key. We\u2019re still building everything out, so stay tuned for more updates soon. **Your info stays private. We\u2019ll never sell, share, or blast your email. This isn\u2019t a startup. It\u2019s a give-back project by Bears, for Bears.**\n\nAppreciate every one of you who\u2019s shown interest and support. GO BEARS!!! \ud83d\udc99 \ud83d\udc9b\n\nPlease upvote this so more alumni can see it lol",

      "content": "I'm majoring in English and that was my plan going into Berkeley, but in my last year at community college I developed a fascination for economics. I decided I would attempt to get an economics minor as well, but upon perusing the website of the Economics department for berkeley, it turns out there is no such thing \u2014 an Economics major is the only program available (which is strange, since the English department has a minor? I'm not sure how minors work, honestly.)\n\nAnyway, I looked at the classes required to get an economics major, and there are a *lot* of classes you need to obtain the major. I got an A in ECON 1B (Macroeconomics) in community college (so at least that will transfer), but I have *nothing* else that will transfer for the program. Even if I could somehow plan out everything to catch up with the progress of my current English major, I feel like I'd be selling my soul. Has anyone else been in a position like this? Do I have time for such a maneuver? I want to talk to a college counselor but new transfer students apparently can't schedule appointments with college advisors until July 15th so I figured I'd ask reddit for at least some advice instead.\n\nY'all have any thoughts to share? To be clear, I'd be dual majoring, I wouldn't be giving up English. I probably didn't make that clear.",

All Cal students. The other gal and I are graduating in Fall 2025 so we will most likely move out by the end of Dec 2025. We don\u2019t really have a gender reference so feel free to DM our way.\n\ud83c\udf1f Vibe Check: chill, respectful, clean, and responsible \ud83d\ude0e ideally comfortable with clear communications and good with following common-area cleaning schedules\n\ud83d\udcf8 Pics/Link to Listing: images attached (the subletting room is the first few images). If you need more images of the bathroom, DM me.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Other Details:\n- Safety: Northside so it\u2019s been quiet for me. You could ask my old/current housemates about this area as well\n- Food: Walkable to Andronico,  Safeway, CVS. Also 3 min walk to Cheeseboard. This area is surrounded by lovely restaurants\n- Landlord Situation: he\u2019s straightforward and chill. He\u2019s old so it might be easier to communicate in person instead of calling or texting. He lives close by so if anything, I could go and talk to him. Responsive when it comes to maintenance/leaking issues \n- Fun Perks: next to cheeseboard, bright and full of sun light, cool temp, pretty quiet area for resting after a long day",

      "content": "I\u2019ll be starting a PhD at Berkeley soon, and I\u2019m choosing among three apartment options. I know that there are tradeoffs for all of these options, and ultimately only I can weigh them, but if people with experience as a PhD student and/or experience living off-campus in Berkeley can give their two cents, that could help a lot! To add some context, I\u2019m an avid cyclist so that\u2019s how I plan to get around. I value urban living (I know Berkeley is more  \u2018dense suburban\u2019 in much of the city) in that I like being decently close to at least a few cafes and restaurants. And a bar, ideally. It would be great to not have to share stuff with too many roommates \u2014 I currently live in a tight four-bed, and kitchen space has been a source of frustration (though not conflict) from time to time. I\u2019d also love to not have to share a bathroom with too many people. \n\nIt would also be helpful to know if these rents are reasonable for their locations. In the city I\u2019m coming from, I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at sniffing out when a place is overpriced. I\u2019m pretty okay with living a bit farther from campus to pay less\u2014again, I\u2019m an avid cyclist and I\u2019m pretty confident that I can get around easily that way. \n\n**Option 1:** I can pay $1145/month to live about 1.5 miles west of campus in a decently sized furnished room with a private bathroom and four roommates. But it\u2019s farther from cafes, restaurants and bars, as well as a mile from BART. I\u2019d also have to walk about a mile to get to any grocery store. \n\n**Option 2:** I can pay $1225/month to live about 1.8 miles from campus in a huge furnished room with two roommates, one bathroom, and no dishwasher. I\u2019d be 5 minutes from BART and walking distance to numerous bars, restaurants, and grocery stores. It\u2019s right by the Oakland border and close-ish to Temescal/Bushrod, so my guess is it isn\u2019t near tons of undergrads but idk. My pause is that I\u2019d be sharing the bathroom with two other people. \n\n**Option 3:** I can pay $1500/month to live about 2.3 miles in a studio in Temescal (Oakland). It would be unfurnished. It\u2019d be very close to a few grocery stores and about a 15 minute walk from BART. My pause is that this is significantly pricier than every other option, and the PhD stipend at Berkeley is very good as far as stipends go, but it\u2019s not high. I\u2019d be spending 38% of my pre-tax income on rent. ",

Learn more and submit a foster application today at[\u00a0](https://houserabbit.org/foster)[houserabbit.org/foster](http://houserabbit.org/foster). We are located in Richmond, just north of Berkeley, but we welcome fosters from all over the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nFostering is a short-term, high-impact way to help a rabbit in need, and it's especially great if you've been thinking about adopting but aren't quite sure if a rabbit is the right fit. We ask for just a two-week commitment, and we'll send you home with everything you need to get started: an x-pen, litter box, bedding, food, hay, bowls, blankets, and more. All you provide is a safe, loving space, daily care, and fresh greens (about $5\u201310 per week).\n\nIt's amazing what a couple weeks in a calm, caring home can do for a shy or nervous rabbit. Your support helps them open up, gain confidence, and prepare for adoption. And by fostering, you also help us make room at our shelter for more rabbits who need to be rescued!\n\nHave questions? Stop by our facility and chat with House Rabbit Society volunteers and staff during our open hours on Fridays and Saturdays from 11 to 4, and Sundays from 11 to 3, or email\u00a0[foster@houserabbit.org](mailto:foster@houserabbit.org).

Been there, done that... it\u2019s rough. As someone who\u2019s been through that cycle of hell, I wanted to try building something to make it suck a little less for fellow Bears.\n\nSo I\u2019m building something for us: a **Berkeley-only Discord** that\u2019s more than just chat. It\u2019s a focused **pipeline** for resume help and job referrals... no coffee chat, no fluff, no corporate vibes, just Bears helping Bears.\n\n# The Goal\n\nBuild a no-BS space where:\n\n* Students get resume help from people who actually know what hiring managers/recruiters want (Roast Your Resume, Get brutally honest feedback about your resume)\n* Alumni refer students when they\u2019re ready\n* Everyone feels comfortable and chill asking for help and offering help\n\n# The Roadmap\n\n**Stage 1: Core Alumni Team**  \nRight now I\u2019m gathering a small group of grads who:\n\n* Are working (or recently hired) and down to help\n* Can review resumes and submit referrals right after\n* Have 1\u20132 hours a week max to give back\n\nNot looking for career coaches. Just regular folks who remember the struggle and want to help someone else through it.\n\n**Stage 2: Early Access for Students & New Grads**  \nOnce we have a decent core, I\u2019ll invite a small batch of Berkeley students/recent grads to test the system. You\u2019ll:\n\n* Submit your resume\n* Get it reviewed by someone who's been in your shoes\n* Get referred when your resume\u2019s in good shape\n\nThis is **not** a spammy job board. It\u2019s 1-on-1 discord help.\n\n**Stage 3: Structured Roles + Submission System**  \nWe\u2019ll build out some simple structure:\n\n* Resume Reviewers (alumni volunteers)\n* Referral Leads (people who actually submit referrals internally or submit directly to recruiters, not just a social job link)\n* Submission queue with deadlines (e.g., 72-hour review turnaround)\n\n**Why This Matters**\n\nThere are so many alumni who *would* help if someone just asked... but most students never do. They don\u2019t know how, or it feels awkward. This fixes that. It\u2019s all about making help **easy to ask for** and **easy to give**. No weird LinkedIn DM, no waiting three weeks for someone to \u201ccircle back.\u201d\n\nAnd let\u2019s be real \u2014 **f\\*ck cold LinkedIn DMs and coffee chats.**\n\nNo one wants to hop on a \u201cquick 15-minute coffee chat\u201d after a full day of work or meeting just to talk in circles and pretend we\u2019re networking. Both alumni and students are tired. This is for people who want to cut the fluff and actually help each other get jobs \u2014 fast.\n\nEveryone in the server will be [**berkeley.edu**](http://berkeley.edu) **verified**. No randos. Just a chill, focused space where Berkeley students and grads can connect, review resumes fast, drop referrals fast, and move on with their lives.\n\nAnd yeah, it\u2019s 100% free. The only rule? If you get a job (through this thing or not), you have to come back and help the next Bear. Review a resume. Drop a referral. Keep the cycle going. No excuses. No freeloaders. Just a low-key referral cult built on good karma and getting sh\\*t done.\n\nNot sure yet which industries we'll focus on... honestly just seeing who shows up first. Could start with tech, but if we get folks from consulting, finance, biotech, etc., we\u2019ll adapt. Totally depends on the mix of grads who want to help.\n\n# Interested?\n\n# Alum: If you\u2019re down to review a few resumes and keep refer someone now and then, drop a comment or DM me. Doesn\u2019t have to be a big time commitment.\n\nStudents/New Grads: If this sounds like something you\u2019d join once it\u2019s live, plese upvote this post... I\u2019ll slowly roll out invites once we\u2019re ready and have enough folks who can help.\n\nP.S. We're the same people who started the Free Food@Berkeley Discord in 2022, which turned out to be pretty successful... That was fun, now we\u2019re just looking to build something new that\u2019s actually useful. Hope you'll be part of it.

ScanBerkeley was dedicated to monitoring and sharing urgent public safety info from UCPD, Berkeley PD, and Berkeley FD radio traffic. I wanted to post here about something that\u2019s about to impact public safety and transparency for everyone at UC Berkeley.\n\n  \nUCPD is now planning to encrypt their main dispatch radio channels along with most agencies around the East Bay. They \"claim\" this is required by a DOJ mandate regarding personal information. That is false. Units can run information via their vehicle computers (MDTs) and be in full compliance. They can use a second channel (which BPD already does). They can even \"break\" apart transmissions so information is not sent together, and still be in full compliance.\n\nHere is a section of the requirement to be in compliance: \n\n>\u201cEstablish policy to restrict dissemination of specific information that would provide for the protection of restricted CJI database information and combinations of name and other data elements that meet the definition of PII. This will provide for the protection of CJI and PII while allowing for radio traffic with the information necessary to provide public safety.\u201d\n\n\u00a0*(Source: California DOJ Information Bulletin, Confidentiality of CLETS Information, p. 2; FBI CJIS Security Policy Sections 5.10.1.2 & 5.13.1.1)*\n\n  \nWhy does this matter?\n\n* UCPD\u2019s real-time notification system has major issues. For years, WarnMe alerts have been vague, delayed, or missing critical context. If you\u2019ve ever received a generic \u201cpolice activity in the area\u201d message, you know how unhelpful that can be in a real emergency.\n* There have been many incidents where UCPD\u2019s official alerts excluded key descriptions like the suspect race, locations, etc. In many of these cases, I was able to provide that information within seconds of a dispatch, while the campus community waited hours (or never received an update) from official sources.\n* Open dispatch channels allow nearby police, fire, and emergency services (EOCs) to stay aware of ongoing incidents and respond more effectively. Full encryption makes cross-agency coordination harder, slows down emergency responses, and ultimately undermines community safety. *(FUN FACT: Campus staff/response personnel even used my tweets during an active incident once because PD took so long to tell them. Will key staff get encrypted radio access? Doubt it.)*\n\n\n\nWhat about officer safety? What if criminals are listening?\n\nWhile this is a valid worry in certain tactical situations, most agencies already handle sensitive operations on separate encrypted tactical channels, keeping the main dispatch open for routine calls. In practice, general dispatch rarely includes the kind of information that would compromise officer safety, and any critical details can be quickly moved to a secure channel if needed. It\u2019s also important to understand that even with full voice encryption, the control channels used by digital radio systems remain unencrypted. These control channels still reveal which radio IDs are active, which talkgroups are being used, and when units are transmitting. With the right tools and some research, someone could still monitor patterns and activity.\n\n\n\nFinal argument, IT IS ALL PUBLIC RECORDS! Anyone can request the audio. All this changes is some intern will likely need to go redact small portions of the radio traffic. Only major issue with this, is UC Berkeley's public records takes months to return. (I am still waiting for some from 2 years ago).\n\n\n\nThanks to a city council resolution, **Berkeley PD is required to keep their primary dispatch open to the public.** ([https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2021-09-28%20Item%2018%20Lease%20Agreement%20with%20Motorola%20-%20Supp%20Harrison.pdf](https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2021-09-28%20Item%2018%20Lease%20Agreement%20with%20Motorola%20-%20Supp%20Harrison.pdf)) There are no current plans to encrypt the fire department radio traffic. UCPD is not subject to these restrictions. To be clear, TAC channels should be encrypted. Tactical incidents can always be moved to a secondary channel. I am only pushing for dispatch to remain open.\n\n\n\nIf you care about this, now is the time to speak up. Contact the Chancellor, ASUC, UCPD Accountability Board, and tell them you want UCPD to keep dispatch channels open like Berkeley PD will be doing. Anyway, happy to discuss more below. :)",

I have Math H53, Physics 89, Physics 5B, and Theater Dance & Performance Studies (as an elective + breadth requirement fulfillment). I've already taken Calc 3, Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations through a local community college, but since I'm from out of state, it's a much more difficult process to see if my credits will count towards Math 53 & 54. Additionally, my advisor recommended that I take Math 53 since Berkeley math is a lot more difficult than community college math so it wouldn't necessarily be redundant to take a course I already know lots of the material from. \n\nHowever, after seeing that STEM courses have lecture and discussion times, I've realized that I don't want to take 3 STEM classes my first semester since it will make my schedule and workload super packed. Is it okay to only take 3 classes (ie. taking math H53, physics 5B, & theater in the fall, and then physics 89 the next semester), or should I replace one of the STEM classes I'm considering with another elective or breadth requirement?

I visited the campus and fell in love with it and wanted nothing more than to go. I wasn't offered any financial aid so I have appealed and for the past couple of months my mindset has been that I will go for all four years if I get aid after the appeal and go to cc first if not. Yesterday morning my parents sat me down and told me that they did the numbers and they figured out a way to send me to berkeley if I take out the 20k of debt (previously it was going to be a lotttt more debt), and then a couple of hours later I got my housing offer so now I have to decide what to do before I leave for a trip in 15 hours. I am majoring in astrophysics, but I don't know what I want to do for a living, so I do not know if I will go on to graduate school. Throughout all of high school my mindset has been \"only # years till I am at college\" and I could not wait to move out and start my own life, but theses past couple of months the idea of community college has grown on me. For reference I live in southern california, and like where I live a lot so there are pros to staying but I am also scared of missing out on all of the friends and connections made in the first two years. I really don't know what to do, so I am grateful for any and all advice given. Thank you! ",

      "title": "General Insights regarding Alum email and CalNet account after graduation (2025)",
      "content": "I posted this comment under someone\u2019s question but they deleted their post. I\u2019m sharing again since it might be helpful. \n\nThis should apply to both undergrad and grad students who graduate from Cal in 2025 (at least). Btw, the Alumni Email Service (google search alumni email service bconnected) should be the most updated place to go to since the policy has been changed a bit during a couple of years. \n\n0. Eligibility for an alum email: check Alumni Email Service page\n\n1. CalNet account vs Berkeley email address:\n\nCalNet account includes info about your UID, CalNet ID (ie. the username of the CalNet account), student ID, Berkeley email address, affiliations, etc. You could check info about your CalNet account on CalNet Account Manager dashboard via mycalnet.berkeley.edu\n\nYou could say that your Berkeley email is a part of your CalNet account and it\u2019s the thing that you still have access to even if your CalNet account expired (you don\u2019t need to fill out any form to claim your alum email INITIALLY, but you need to follow the instructions from \u201cAlumni Email Service\u201d to MAINTAIN it after graduation).\n\n2. Grace period and access to Berkeley services/apps and third-party apps:\nAfter you graduate, at some point, you will receive an email informing you that your active student/employee affiliation has terminated and you have entered the grace period. During this grace period, you will still have access to a lot of applications/services on campus (google search grace period at berkeley to see more info). So you can use this time period to transfer any data needed from those services/applications to somewhere you still have access to (ie. your personal google account, external drive, computer, etc).\n\nThe applications I mentioned do not include Microsoft 365, Adobe, etc. For such 3rd party applications that you are granted free access as a registered student\u2014since you graduate, you will become not-registered student at some point\u2014and that prevents you from accessing such apps. So for this case, I would recommend to transfer data (from Adode, Microsoft, etc) before you actually graduate. You could check what apps you are eligible for from \u201cSoftware Eligibility\u201d (google search the term).\n\nAt certain points during your grace period, you might receive some emails like \u201cYour CalNet account is expiring in 3months/2weeks/etc.\u201d If so, this kind of emails is to list what services/apps you won\u2019t have access anymore after your grace period ends (for example: CalCentral, bCourses, etc). It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t have access to Berkeley email anymore.\n\nWhat I mean is, that even after the grace period, you still have access to your Berkeley email (because in the latest policy, you don\u2019t need to fill out any form to claim your alum email account) as long as you follow the activity requirement in Alumni Email Service to keep your alum email after graduation.\n\n3. the 5gb requirement:\nThis requirement is for the overall storage of your bConnected Google account (which includes your Berkeley email). You need to keep it below 5gb. Or else, after grace period, you will be unable to send/receive emails outside of @berkeley.edu domain.\n3.1. So is that ok if I have over 5gb during grace period? Yeah, even if you exceed 5gb in your overall storage, you can still send/receive emails outside of @berkeley.edu DURING the grace period. But you should use this time to transfer data to keep it below 5gb instead of waiting until last minutes. It\u2019s very time consuming.\n\n4. How to keep your CalNet account from expiring?\ncoming back to Cal to take classes, or becoming a staff/faculty is one of the ways to prevent your CalNet account from expiring. But I\u2019m sure what most people care about after graduation is keeping the email rather than the CalNet account.\n\np/s feel free to add on or update any info you know",

Stay tuned! \n\n \\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nJust wanted to post a quick update because\u2026 wow. It seems like a lot of people are interested in this idea, and honestly, the response has been amazing. We\u2019ve officially gotten the green light to go ahead, and we\u2019re going to start rolling this out soon (Green light really just means a few of us (Cal Bears) agreed to spend our weekend working on this... we all have full-time jobs after all)...\n\n**First step: pulling together a  crew of alumni who are down to help with resume reviews and job referrals.**\n\nIf you're a Cal grad working in tech, consulting, finance, biotech, or **really anywhere**, and you remember how much the job hunt sucked... we\u2019d love to have you on board.

Say \u201cyour resume sucks and needs work\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t refer you yet\u201d ... that kind of honesty is more valuable than any coffee chat.\n* You were lost, stressed, and under-qualified once too. Don't forget what it felt like to need a hand and not know where to ask.\n* You don\u2019t have to be a  career coach, just be a human who remembers the grind.\n* No one's selling anything.

You wait a week to meet with some random career advisor who\u2019s never worked in tech, finance, or literally any industry you're applying to. They give you a generic resume template and tell you to \u201cCheck Handshake\u201d or \u201cApply on LinkedIn.\u201d Career fairs? Half the time you're talking to an underpaid event rep who just hands you a flyer and free merch and says \u201cscan QR code and apply on our website.\u201d No follow-up. No Berkeley insider advice.

      "title": "Snake Charming: A Zero-Bullshit Guide for Prospective Haas Transfers",
      "content": "**Manifesto:** Throughout the admissions process, and in my time at Cal, I've felt as if the available advice on transferring to Haas was written with a chronic lack of experience. It seems as if every admissions counselor in the world has the exact same rosy advice for prospective transfers into the UC system, irrespective of each campuses' unique attributes, and most of these \"sources\" fail to address the nuances of specialized majors - especially business admin. Hopefully, this brief guide will provide some novel insight into the routes that my classmates and I took to get into the Haas School as Community College transfers.\n\n**Disclaimer:** ***All opinions and statements herein are proprietary and I am not affiliated with the Haas Undergraduate Admissions Office in any capacity.***\n\n**Edit 11/15/2021:** Changed \"The Interview\" to reflect updated information on the [Haas website](https://haas.berkeley.edu/undergrad/admissions/application-process/). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Index**\n\n* Part 1: You've landed at Community College, now what?\n   * *Since your time in community college will largely determine your chances of admission, this section is* ***much*** *larger than others.*\n* Part 2: The UC Application\n* Part 3: The Haas Supplemental\n* Part 4: The Interview\n* Part 5: The Offer\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Part 1: You've landed at Community College, now what?\n\nThis section is going to be dense, but is vaguely broken up into paragraphs with the following topics:\n\n1. You're in College Now.\n2. Planning Your CC Experience - Big Picture\n3. Planning Your CC Experience (cont.)\n4. Should I get a Degree?\n5. **Work Experience**\n6. Extracurriculars to Pursue\n7. Programs and Events\n\nRegardless of what drove you to enroll at a CC, you now have a new lease on life and a clean academic slate. UC transfers benefit from the unique ability to completely shed their entire High School history. Your prior grades, work experience, extracurriculars, and recommendation letters are not considered in the UC admissions file, so rest easy knowing that your C- in AP Environmental Science is gone with the wind. However, be mindful that *no* private and *few* elite public institutions share this leniency with transfer prospects (eg: UPenn-Wharton, MIT-Sloan, Cornell-Dyson and CMU-Tepper).\n\nIn your time at CC, your counselors will likely fail to offer you any substantiative or meaningful advice because their offices are horrifically underfunded. I know \\~15 Econ/EnvEcon transfers that were dissuaded from applying to Haas by their CC counselors despite having extremely strong backgrounds in industry. **Despite the unceasing shitposts on this sub, Haas students have tremendous respect for those in the College of Letters and Sciences, and I strongly recommend that you only apply for Economics at Cal after thoroughly considering your interests and strengths - while you will have the same access to employment opportunities post-grad, your time in Berkeley will be spent doing highly theoretical and extremely quantitative work.** While you chisel away at CC degree requirements, you will have to do a lot of digging to find course enrollment times, and will generally have to coordinate your coursework schedule all on your own. For this reason, [Assist](https://assist.org) will be your greatest asset in planning the timeline for completing your prerequisite courses. Plan early and often, and do everything in your power to gain priority enrollment at your school. Do your best to maintain a full course load every term, and take a few classes that you actually care about in addition to some difficult quantitative courses. Loading up on strictly business coursework is not advisable in any term, as you will lose your edge in other subjects. Additionally, make sure that you fulfill the requirements for a Transfer Admission Guarantee, and plan to complete prereq's for at least four non-UC business programs. I know a few people that are taking an additional year of CC coursework because they didn't hedge their bets against admission to UCLA or Berkeley. Optionality is everything, and the Econ/Acct and BizEcon programs at UCSB and UCI are great tracks (in more enjoyable locations, climate and campus-wise) that provide greater opportunities and placement than many of the Top-15 undergrad business programs.\n\nAim to have ***all*** of your prerequisite courses done before the Spring Semester (or Winter Quarter) of the year you plan to enter into Haas. This engineers a margin of error for the admissions committee, who can rest assured that *even* *if* you fail your remaining coursework, you are still admissible to Haas. You should aim to have a CC GPA of 4.00 for your best shot, but many transfers have a few A-'s sprinkled in. I know that holding that GPA may sound daunting, but if you are really committed to Haas, you will find a way to make it happen. If it is any consolation, Community College classes were much easier than my HS coursework, and I went to a poorly ranked no-name public high school. Tutoring is widely available at most CC's, and **professors will go out of their way to help driven students succeed**. Additionally, use resources like [Transfer Camp](https://transfercamp.com) and [RateMyProfessor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com) to sift out crappy professors that are overly harsh with grading, or those who simply cannot teach.\n\nI lightly recommend that you get an Associates in Business, as well as *at least one* degree in some other subject. This is not advice for Haas in particular, but rather can set you apart in candidate pools for admission to private schools. Economics, Mathematics and Statistics degrees typically line up well with the Haas prerequisite courses, and only require a few more classes at most schools. A certificate in Accounting is also really helpful no matter where you end up transferring, as you get a significant head start on what is, in my opinion, the most important coursework you will take at Cal.\n\nArguably ***the most impactful part of your admissions profile will be your work experience***. Aim for high-commitment roles in business-related positions. **This** ***seems*** **to be the \"secret sauce\" that pushes applicants to the top of the pile**. Coming from a CC, it will be extremely hard to land \"top-tier\" summer internships, but do your best to find gainful employment in the business sector by whatever means come available to you. **You will have to market hard**, I sent hundreds of resumes and went through dozens of informational interviews before I got a single offer, and know many others that have had similar experiences. Use LinkedIn, follow a Resume Template, and try your best to be personable and respectful of every person you meet. Once you get into a role, keep your head down, **work your ass off,** and learn as much as you can. Whether you get a 9-5 job or not, Entrepreneurship is looked upon extremely favorably in the Berkeley community, and if you have a clear vision of your product, I'd explore that avenue if possible.\n\nNow let's talk extracurriculars. UC Berkeley loves seeing applicants with demonstrated leadership ability, as well as those who exhibit excellence in civic engagement. I think that heading your student government and/or being a leader of a club is the easiest way to tick this box, but have seen other transfer students demonstrate this ability off-campus in non-profits and NGO's. Put simply - you will have to find something that is deeply meaningful to you and take initiative. As I'll cover later, there are only four spots for extracurriculars in the Haas application, so make sure that you have a good breath of experiences. **If you put \"Club Member\" down four times, you have failed to demonstrate your ability to be an effective leader.**\n\nThere are dozens of programs and events that each give you incremental boosts in your chances of admission to a top UC campus, and I'll cover two here. First and foremost - I highly recommend that you take honors curriculum (if available) at your CC and become a part of the honors community. Honor class materials are generally unchanged from the standard curriculum, and the classes only require an extra paper or project that is fairly easily completed. With the satisfactory completion of your schools honors program, you may be eligible for the TAP program at Cal/UCLA, and Honors to Honors at UCI, among others.  Second - attending \"Envision Haas\" events was a great way to connect with the Berkeley campus and garner some motivation to push through the application process. If you can spare a day to make the trip, or live in the area, I'd highly recommend it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Part 2: The UC Application\n\nAfter over a year of slogging through the hideous bureaucracy and lackluster campus life at your junior college, it's finally time to shine.\n\nThe collection of resources regarding generic UC application advice is broad, and most of it is applicable to any college application process. My points mostly mirror what you can find on any admission counselors website. Be sure to look back on applicable and meaningful experiences, bullet-out your points, and **be** ***sure as hell*** **that you have compelling personal, professional, and academic reasons to be admitted**.\n\nThe Personal insight Questions are unquestionably the most painful part of the application process. You'll be forced to write about deeply meaningful topics with a crippling word count constraint. Give your admissions reader a chance to relish in your success by offering them a defined narrative, clear wording, robust paragraphical structure, and a reason to care. If you don't find yourself needing to trim off \\~200 words after your first attempt to address a prompt, you should probably pick a different one.\n\nWhile still painful, the activities section of the application places a ceiling on the level of misery you will experience. Since you only have four spots for each section, make sure to only use your most impactful experiences in this section. EG: While your involvement in the chess/hiking/math/etc... club may have been a significant portion of your community college experience, it should take a clear backseat to your tenure as the student body president. Simplify your bulleted action items in a fashion that would make them easy-to-read for a toddler, and don't list anything you can't back up.\n\n**DO NOT** wait until the last moment to start or submit your application. You should have 4-5 peers/professional coworkers/family members read through the entirety of your application to make sure it doesn't suck. Additionally, even though we have the #1 computer science department in the country, our application website still finds a way to crash on November 31st like clockwork - and extensions are rarely granted.\n\n# Part 3: The Haas Application\n\nUnless you stumbled upon this guide after submitting the UC app, your activities section should remain mostly the same across your UC and Haas applications. Be sure to extrapolate the key points, and make it exceedingly easy for readers to understand why you are a rockstar that belongs at Haas.\n\nAdditionally, the Haas essay will have a similarly vague and uncomfortable prompt that will require you to dig deep for meaningful answers. The prompt seems to cycle around every 4-5 years, and will generally cover an easy behavioral question you will have seen in at least one of your interviews up to this point (Eg: tell us about a failure, how did you foster a collaborative environment, etc). As always, you should plan to triple-check your writing with others before submitting, and submit early.\n\n# Part 4: The Interview\n\nHistorically, the interview was a \"final check\" for transfer applicants. For example - I don't know a single person in the '22 or '23 transfer class that did not have an interview. \n\nHowever, the interview is now being offered to all applicants, and is an optional part of the process. Given how the interview was used in prior admissions cycles, **I would unequivocally  recommend you take the opportunity to submit an interview**.\n\nBe sure to dress for the occasion (business professional with tasteful tie), brush up on your interviewing skills, and go into the experience with confidence. Questions from prior years are always floating around on CollegeConfidential, but the topics covered in the interview are extremely basic and should come easily to you if you've done any interviewing for other schools or jobs. The interview format was lackluster for me, and I had to pace myself through the six answers you will provide over six minutes. Make sure to use the [STAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result) method to formulate your responses, and don't waste time. Previously, you had two chances to do the interview, and the questions do not change if you reattempt your recording. If this remains the same, I'd highly recommend that you use the second chance if you don't feel as if your first was 100%.\n\n# Part 5: The Offer\n\nYour decision will come much faster than you expect.\n\nIf you get the offer - Congratulations. Go celebrate, and then get ready to grind and network like never before. I *highly recommend* that you enroll in the PreCore program and begin your housing search immediately.\n\nIf you don't get the offer - don't worry. Keep an open mind to other programs that will enable a similar level of personal and professional development, and knock the lights out once you enroll. Keep maintaining your focus on academics and demonstrate success in employment to prove the undergraduate admissions committee wrong when you apply for your MBA.\n\n**Either way, work hard and never stop learning.**",

      "title": "Business Club Ratings + Tea",
      "content": "Welcome back to school! I recently graduated and wanted to provide an honest but informed perspective of the various business clubs. These opinions are my own so definitely do your own research.\n\nClub recruitment may seem trivial (because it is), but joining the right club can make or break the type of friend group you form, the parties you are invited to, and even the internships/job you attain.\n\nIf you feel lost or confused by the club scene, know that you\u2019re not alone. Sproul Plaza always crawls with undifferentiated club salespeople screaming, \u201cinterested in \\_\\_\\_?\u201d I remember thinking, \u201cwhat the f\\*\\*\\* are consulting clubs?\u201d Many of my floormates, however, came from Bay Area feeder schools (MSJHS, Paly, Saratoga, Lynbrook, etc.) and inherited an army of helpful upperclassmen that guided them through club recruitment. They freely received valuable advice I felt was hard to come by. This ranged from which clubs to target to what interview questions to expect. Although I eventually found my footing, I can confidently say the odds were stacked against me and will be the same for many of you. So I write this in hopes of (slightly) uplifting any fellow underdogs out there.\n\nIf I were to run the gauntlet again, some of the criteria I would evaluate clubs via:\n\n* **Achievement**: How well do members recruit professionally, and what fields do they recruit best for? Sure, fulltime recruiting is largely an individual pursuit. But if a club consistently recruits well, that may indicate hard-working and professionally oriented members, a robust network that aided them in that journey, and a structured mentorship program to get you off the ground. If that matters to you, of course.\n* **Commitment**: What is the club\u2019s expected time commitment on a weekly basis? The standard is generally 10 hours/week, although this can vary significantly.\n* **Culture**: How strong is the club\u2019s internal culture? Every club will say their culture is strong. But to cut through the noise, the best proxy is an average members\u2019 tenure. People vote with their feet, and if members truly care about the club, they stick around in meaningful roles. You\u2019ll see clubs with sophomores (or even freshmen!) in leadership, and that is a huge red flag. That means juniors or seniors don\u2019t give a crap and jump ship to focus on other endeavors. If a club\u2019s juniors/seniors show up to events and are running the club, that means they still have a lot to learn/gain, or they just genuinely enjoy being there.\n* **Development**: Will you learn a lot and get to work on interesting projects? And how well does the club train and develop its members professionally? This may come in the form of external consulting projects, structured development workshops, etc.\n* **Diversity**: How diverse is the academic, ethnic, and professional makeup of the club? This rating will be relative to other clubs, given the disproportionate Asian & Business Major representation in the community. This may be the hardest to pin down accurately.\n\nThe broader club landscape and my ratings:\n\n**Business Frats**: I cannot, in good faith, recommend you join a business frat. The pledging process \u2013 the process of joining \u2013 can be emotionally, verbally, and/or physically abusive. Unless you 100% want to pursue finance, I would advise against business frats.\n\n**Alpha Kappa Psi (AKPsi)**\n\n* **Achievement**: A, very strong for finance and consulting\n* **Commitment**: F, literally your entire life for the first semester but that drops off after pledging\n* **Culture**: C, retention is okay but some serious cultural issues similar to DSP\n* **Development**: C, real learning is mostly done post-pledging in other clubs or internships\n* **Diversity**: D, very little diversity in any category\n\n**Beta Alpha Psi (BAP)**\n\n* **Achievement**: B, mainly finance and consulting but slightly weaker recruiting results than the other two.\n* **Commitment**: F, same as above\n* **Culture**: C, same as above\n* **Development**: C, same as above\n* **Diversity**: D, same as above\n\n**Delta Sigma Pi (DSP) / Rho Consulting / Undergraduate Business Group**\n\n* **Achievement**: A, very strong for finance\n* **Commitment**: F, same as above\n* **Culture**: F, potentially worst among the business frats. They got disbanded due to excessive hazing and have unsuccessfully reformed underground a couple times (hence, the extra names).\n* **Development**: C, similar to above\n* **Diversity**: F, similar to above but only accepts (intended) business majors\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Consulting Groups**: IMO, a legit consulting club is great for learning more about business and padding your resume with projects. All of the discussed clubs are fairly well known.\n\n**Berkeley Consulting (BC)**: Oldest consulting club on the block and no specific type of client. Clout chasers and assholes, look no further.\n\n* **Achievement**: A, mainly consulting with some finance and tech. Lot of Bainees this year, but recruiting success varies.\n* **Commitment**: D, \u201cpseudo-pledging\u201d your first few semesters - 20-30 hours/week time commitment\n* **Culture**: D, potentially the worst culture among consulting clubs. Some members are highly elitist and look down on other clubs and even applicants. They had a mental health workshop due to retention issues and burnout. Not classy.\n* **Development**: A, in exchange for large time commitment, members come out well prepared. Projects are arguably the most robust among the clubs.\n* **Diversity**: D, leadership diversity has been an issue. 5+ years without a female president. They have improved as of late.\n\n**CMG**: Focused on big clients. They\u2019re more under the radar but very solid as a club.\n\n* **Achievement**: B, mainly finance and consulting. The multi-club members recruit better than CMG-only members, however.\n* **Commitment**: B, 10-12 hours/week\n* **Culture**: B, culture is generally good. This is where business frat kids go when they don\u2019t like their business frat.\n* **Development**: B, learning is generally good. Some very good consumer projects \u2013 Nike, Lululemon, Hydro Flask.\n* **Diversity**: C, average\n\n**Net Impact Berkeley (NIB)**: Focused on social impact with large companies or nonprofits. Overall very good vibes.\n\n* **Achievement**: A, mainly consulting and SWE/product management. Members lowkey recruit very well.\n* **Commitment**: B, 10 hours/week\n* **Culture**: A, tied with TBG. Have really only heard positive things. Very social impact-heavy though in case that's not your vibe.\n* **Development**: C, very good tech clients \u2013 Stripe, Lyft, GoDaddy, but not sure how legit their projects actually are.\n* **Diversity**: B, above average\n\n**The Berkeley Group (TBG):** Focused on pro bono projects with nonprofits. Overall very good vibes.\n\n* **Achievement**: B, mainly consulting and SWE. Some members recruit very well, but the average member recruits okay.\n* **Commitment**: B, 8-10 hours/week\n* **Culture**: A, people are very nice and strong culture. Unfortunately, members pay out of pocket for socials because of pro bono nature, but they\u2019ve been doing more paid projects recently.\n* **Development**: B, would be an A for NGO-specific work but doesn\u2019t have as much breadth in terms of clients. If working with nonprofits is your cup of tea, 100% would recommend.\n* **Diversity**: B, same as above\n\n**Voyager Consulting**: Focused on big clients, mostly Fortune 500s. Vibes are similar to BC but not as old and stronger reputation among other business clubs right now.\n\n* **Achievement**: A, mainly finance and consulting. Have sent a couple to BCG and other good firms but varies by grade.\n* **Commitment**: B, 10-12 hours/week\n* **Culture**: C, varies a lot. Some friends really struggled socially in Voyager, but others like it. It can allegedly feel like Mean Girls. If you\u2019re one of the mean girls, then all is well.\n* **Development**: B, fairly good learning and very legit projects\n* **Diversity**: B, above average\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Development Clubs**:\n\n**Berkeley Business Society (BBS**): Hybrid between a business frat and a consulting club. Used to be a stepping stone club for the clubs mentioned earlier, but they compete with consulting clubs nowadays. Fairly negative reputation.\n\n* **Achievement**: A, mainly finance and consulting. Very good placement in big firms.\n* **Commitment**: C, 15 hours/week if you\u2019re in a project team\n* **Culture**: D, people drag BBS culture pretty hard. They had a retention issue because freshmen kept joining for 1 semester just to quit and join a business frat after (they literally chose pledging over BBS lmao). So BBS forced new members (mostly freshmen in their first few weeks of classes) to sign a contract that prevented them from joining other clubs for a full year.\n* **Development**: C, very cool clients, but most people I know didn\u2019t learn a whole ton directly from the club.\n* **Diversity**: F, referred to as Brown Boys Society, enough said. Send tweet.\n\n**Berkeley Investment Group (BIG)**: The best group to join if you want to learn about investing. This may not be a good fit otherwise.\n\n* **Achievement**: A, very strong alumni placement in finance. One of the few places you\u2019ll see alumni consistently land buyside opportunities.\n* **Commitment**: D, 20 hours/week for first semester during internship program and drops to lower amount.\n* **Culture**: C, have heard mixed reviews and that it can be a bit snakey.\n* **Development**: A, they run a really interesting internship program similar to an Analyst under a PM in a HF. One of the truly differentiated development programs.\n* **Diversity**: C, average.\n\n**Undergraduate Finance Association / Undergraduate Management Consulting Group (UFA/UMCG)**: What you get when members of all the clubs decide to make a joint club for extra clout. Low commitment and definitely the best network in Berkeley.\n\n* **Achievement**: A, literally the most hardo of all the other clubs, but UFA-only members are hit/miss for recruiting.\n* **Commitment**: A, 2-4 hours/week\n* **Culture**: C, there really isn\u2019t a culture tbh. A couple friend groups form, but it exists more for the network.\n* **Development**: C, mentorship program, but people don\u2019t feel bought in.\n* **Diversity**: D, little to no diversity\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome other well-known clubs that are probably a tier or two below:\n\n* **180D:** Nice people, but professionalism does not seem strong.\n* **ABA**: The oldest business club on campus. I consider this a \u201cfirst semester club,\u201d meaning it\u2019s a great steppingstone to other clubs. But most people don\u2019t stick around for very long.\n* **Phi Beta Lambda (PBL)**: Knock-off ABA\n* **Phoenix Consulting:** More low-key, but I\u2019ve heard good things about the culture. Healthcare-focused, so it\u2019s good for premed folks.\n* **Venture Strategy Solutions (VSS):** Consulting club focused on startups. They\u2019ve been ahead of the game with diversity initiatives.\n* **Valley Consulting Group (VCG):** Tech consulting club focused on large tech companies and startups. Hybrid between a Blueprint/Codebase and a consulting club.

And UCLA starts being snarky that it's \"still number one\".\n\nThe publicity is framed as if they're completely separate institutions with no historical or current connections.\n\nLast I looked, both Berkeley and UCLA had \"UC\" in their official name. They're part of the best college public education system (perhaps the best education system) ever created. \n\nBut they (especially UCLA) often act like they're completely different institutions with no shared history or beyond happening somehow to be located in the same state. \n\nI just took a look at the UCLA website. \"UCLA\" is the label everywhere. Nowhere did I see in any prominent place \"University of California\" mentioned as part of the name or identity. Even their purported main \"history\" page starts with 1920 (when ROTC was introduced to the Westwood campus), not 1868, when the University of California was created, or even the 'teens when the \"Southern Branch\" of UC began to take form.\n\nWe all know about sibling rivalry.  And I realize that for students applying to go to college, they're distinct entities and a campus \"brand\" matters.  \n\nBut both are still part of an incredible and enviable purportedly unified university system. That matters, too, because it shows that public education can achieve and sustain greatness over considerable geographical, political, and social distances. \n\nThat's REALLY important in times like these when so many people seem to think that the solution to everything is privatization and control of government and public policy by a billionaire class and corporations, and government institutions can't do anything well.  \n\nI just wish UCLA would stop pretending that it somehow appeared from nowhere and is not really part of a statewide public university system with ten campuses, all of them good, and several of them internationally great. \n\nOverall, I think the two individual institutions (UCLA and UC Berkeley) would be stronger if they both regularly acknowledged and emphasized they're siblings, part of a great family, and the leading parts of that greater whole.
